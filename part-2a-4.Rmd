# Outreach

This section summarizes interviews and additional outreach with non-profit and for-profit multifamily developers with existing or prospective projects in the county. 

## Process

To gather additional details on the state of Chesterfield County's rental market, a total of ___ persons from ___ organizations were interviewed in early June 2022. These interviews collected views from:

* For-profit multifamily and mixed use developers,
* Nonprofit multifamily developers and property managers, and
* Commercial real estate brokers focused on multifamily and mixed use properties.

Specific interview topics and questions varied, but were organized around the prevalent trends, challenges, and opportunities found today in the county's rental market.

## Trends

- County will only get more expensive -- but acceleration may slow as interest rates rise
- Market has "shot straight up"
- Far more demand than supply
- Class A, B, and C apartment properties are all performing very well
- Increasing demand for family-sized apartments
- Quality of schools can drive migration of families with young children from Richmond and Tri-Cities
- Class A demand is from WFH persons/households and long-term county residents downsizing

NOAH
- Not as many property sales as higher class assets
- Long-term owners are tax averse and don't want to deal with selling process and capital gains tax

Affordable
- Long waiting lists for affordable apartments
- Demand for affordable senior housing will grow as life expectancy continues to rise

## Challenges

- Expectation for first-floor commerical component can make financing difficult (standalone multifamily is easier)
- 8 out of 10 calls (to broker) are from pure multifamily developers who don't do mixed use

Affordable
- Increasing political obstructions for affordable rental housing development, especially along Route 1 ("victim of its own success" following some successful developments)
- Limited opportunities to purchase existing NOAH to preserve as affordable (too expensive)
- Utility connection and permit fees can be high relative to other localities, along with road proffers
- High acquisition costs overall

Corridors
- Route 1 associated with crime, whether reality reflects scale of problem or not
- "Afraid" to build above Willis Rd
- Market study would probably not be favorable for market-rate development along northern areas of Route 1

## Opportunities

Affordable
- Getting sites designated by county as "revitalization areas" helps with LIHTC scoring, practice should continue
- Even small amounts of tax abatement from county would increase LIHTC scoring
- Despite some opposition, citizens and residents will demonstrate support for new affordable rental housing
- Continued rental development in areas served by GRTC is ideal

Corridors
- Hull Street likely to continue performing better than Route 1 (less of a "stigma" and strong western component)
- Hull Street seeing more activity/interest, will continue to grow organically like Midlothian Turnpike
- Chance to revive/reuse vacant commercial space in Route 1 / Chester / I-95 area
- County would need to provide meaningful incentives to attract market-rate development in northern Route 1
