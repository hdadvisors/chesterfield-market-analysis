From zero completed units in 2018 to a five year high of 1,569 units in 2020, development has been sporadic but is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Most recent developments have consisted of low-rise buildings, offering amenities such as clubhouses, pools, and fitness centers.\n\nAs of June 2022, there were 33 existing market-rate multifamily developments that were either built in the last five years, under construction, or proposed. An additional development is a mixed-income senior rental housing project by Better Housing Coalition that was completed recently. Development in the past five years has generally been spread across the county, but only one development was completed in the Dale District.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {#fig-recent-mf .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-fa9c10d2c0cfbfbd5b10\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\" class=\"leaflet html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-fa9c10d2c0cfbfbd5b10\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"CartoDB.Positron\",null,null,{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false}]},{\"method\":\"addCircleMarkers\",\"args\":[[37.463447,37.3879938,37.5118752,37.5105924,37.4704738,37.5152693,37.385989,37.4161673,37.4024981,37.3590129,37.4509959,37.395725,37.4268763,37.4169455,37.399948,37.5173148,37.5036969,37.3621348,37.4224921,37.509398,37.5162239,37.4431249,37.3500934,37.3586547,37.4749512,37.4218539,37.4990468,37.5052285,37.5077936,37.4997024,37.4529259,37.4057477,37.406681,37.4066597],[-77.664415,-77.6782917,-77.5326124,-77.5346073,-77.6614462,-77.6988542,-77.4258182,-77.6245689,-77.710331,-77.4454843,-77.6398079,-77.7405882,-77.695146,-77.4357878,-77.431476,-77.6071521,-77.669418,-77.4099752,-77.4396854,-77.62733,-77.6902964,-77.6416094,-77.4894109,-77.443,-77.6599419,-77.497621,-77.6917785,-77.6929055,-77.6632126,-77.5550052,-77.6432931,-77.6380479,-77.6376289,-77.637071],4,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"className\":\"\",\"stroke\":false,\"color\":[\"#FDB462\",\"#FB8072\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#FDB462\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#FB8072\",\"#FB8072\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#FDB462\",\"#FB8072\",\"#FB8072\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#FDB462\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#FDB462\",\"#BEBADA\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#FDB462\",\"#FB8072\",\"#FB8072\",\"#FB8072\"],\"weight\":5,\"opacity\":0.5,\"fill\":true,\"fillColor\":[\"#FDB462\",\"#FB8072\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#FDB462\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#FB8072\",\"#FB8072\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#FDB462\",\"#FB8072\",\"#FB8072\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#FDB462\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#8DD3C7\",\"#FDB462\",\"#BEBADA\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#80B1D3\",\"#FDB462\",\"#FB8072\",\"#FB8072\",\"#FB8072\"],\"fillOpacity\":0.9},null,null,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]},{\"method\":\"addLegend\",\"args\":[{\"colors\":[\"#8DD3C7\",\"#FDB462\",\"#BEBADA\",\"#FB8072\",\"#80B1D3\"],\"labels\":[\"Bermuda\",\"Clover Hill\",\"Dale\",\"Matoaca\",\"Midlothian\"],\"na_color\":null,\"na_label\":\"NA\",\"opacity\":1,\"position\":\"topright\",\"type\":\"factor\",\"title\":\"District\",\"extra\":null,\"layerId\":null,\"className\":\"info legend\",\"group\":null}]},{\"method\":\"addControl\",\"args\":[\"<div>Source: CoStar Group, Inc.<\\/div>\",\"bottomright\",null,\"info legend\"]}],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[37.3500934,37.5173148],\"lng\":[-77.7405882,-77.4099752]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n\nRecent multifamily developments by magisterial district\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThirty-two percent of recent and future development has been or will be constructed in the Midlothian District.

A review of these studies found that \"property value increased when LIHTC developments are built in low-income areas\" and furthermore, decreases in crime are associated with LIHTC development.[^part-2a-2-4] Even the location of LIHTC development in high opportunity areas has proven to have positive impacts.[^part-2a-2-5]\n\n[^part-2a-2-4]: Keri-Nicole Dillman, Keren Mertens Horn & Ann Verrilli (2017) The What, Where, and When of Place-Based Housing Policy's Neighborhood Effects, Housing Policy Debate, 27:2, 282-305, DOI: 10.1080/10511482.2016.1172103\n\n[^part-2a-2-5]: *Ibid*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Subsidy type by magisterial district](part-2a-2_files/figure-html/fig-aff-type-1.png){#fig-aff-type width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLIHTC in the County has largely been developed by for profit developers with only one non-profit developer in the county, Better Housing Coalition (BHC). BHC, one of the Richmond region's largest nonprofit developers of affordable housing, has concentrated much of their work along Route One --- where they first developed their first phase of Winchester Green townhomes in 1999.[^part-2a-2-6] Since 1999, Better Housing Coalition has continued to phase development with Market Square and will continue develop on adjacent parcels with Winchester Forest.\n\n[^part-2a-2-6]: Phase 1 of Winchester Greens was financed by a \\$5.8 million bond issued by the Chesterfield County Industrial Development Authority, \\$13.8 million from HUD, and \\$800,000 in Community Development Block Grant from Chesterfield County.\n\nPrograms like LIHTC have a time frame for affordability restrictions. For LIHTC in Virginia, like many other states, there is a 30 year commitment to affordability, but only a 15 year compliance period, wherein property owners can increase rents. By 2040, the majority of existing LIHTC housing (1,984 homes) will be outside the 30 year commitment period. Nonprofit developers will often seek new allocation of tax credits before their commitment period ends, but there is often little incentive for for-profit developers to maintain affordability restrictions past the compliance period.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![LIHTC housing at risk of loss of affordability by year](part-2a-2_files/figure-html/fig-loss-1.png){#fig-loss width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Source: National Housing Preservation Database*\n\nLIHTC developments in the Bermuda and Dale Districts are set to face the end of the affordability commitment period before 2040, but Bermuda District LIHTC properties are largely nonprofit owned and managed --- therefore, less likely at risk of loss. But Dale District LIHTC properties could face significant risk of exiting from the affordable housing stock.\n\n### Price comparison\n\nThe following makes comparisons between affordable multifamily and market-rate multifamily rental prices across Chesterfield County. CoStar data is incomplete for some properties, but still provides an accurate and up-to-date average market asking rent per unit by property. The analysis below includes 96 multifamily properties where average asking rent data is available. It excludes manufactured home communities and single-family rentals.\n\nThe map below shows the location of market rate, affordable (rent restricted or rent subsidized), and market/affordable multifamily developments. The size of the circle represents the average asking market rent per unit for each property. The map shows a large amount of market rate properties located in the northern section of the county, specifically along Midlothian Turnpike and Route 288. Affordable rental properties, including those that are mixed-income, are largely located towards the eastern part of the county along Route 1 and Route 10.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Map of average rent by property type](part-2a-2_files/figure-html/fig-price-comparison-map-1.png){#fig-price-comparison-map width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMarket rate rents skew towards the \\$1,500 to \\$2,000 range, with two properties well-above the \\$2,000 rent level. These two properties are high-end properties; one being a townhome development and the other a senior independent living with substantial amenities and programming. Affordable rental properties have rents that sit closer to \\$1,000, which would require at least $40,000 annually to not be cost-burdened. Market/affordable rents are scattered but are typically between \\$1,000 and \\$1,500. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Average asking rents by rent type](part-2a-2_files/figure-html/fig-pcomp-hist-county-1.png){#fig-pcomp-hist-county width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe following chart shows the distribution of rental properties by their average rent for each magisterial district. The Bermuda district has the largest share of lower-cost apartments, supplied by both rent-restricted and market rate properties. The Dale district has the next highest number of low-cost apartments of all types. The Midlothian district has the highest average rents, with most properties ranging well above \\$1,500.\n \n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of properties by average rent by district](part-2a-2_files/figure-html/fig-pcomp-hist-dist-1.png){#fig-pcomp-hist-dist width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
