The analysis reflects the ability for Chesterfield workforce to pay for current housing costs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Background\n\nAffording a home in Chesterfield County—whether to own or rent— is directly tied to the incomes that households earn. There are diverse job opportunities across the region, and while some common jobs do pay well-above minimum wage, housing costs are rising faster.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-top-occupations .cell tbl-cap='Top five most common occupations in Chesterfield County'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r}\n\\hline\nOccupation & Jobs & Mean hourly wage & Mean annual wage\\\\\n\\hline\nRetail salespersons & 18,770 & \\$13.85 & \\$28,800\\\\\n\\hline\nFast food and counter workers & 16,930 & \\$11.29 & \\$23,490\\\\\n\\hline\nCustomer service representatives & 13,560 & \\$17.51 & \\$36,410\\\\\n\\hline\nRegistered nurses & 12,910 & \\$36.99 & \\$76,940\\\\\n\\hline\nHome health and personal care aides & 9,390 & \\$11.51 & \\$23,930\\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\rule{0pt}{1em}\\textit{Sources: } Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, May 2021.}\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA diverse workforce also requires diverse housing for those workers. When workers can’t find housing in a community, they either have to commute in or they search for work elsewhere. More in-commuters can exacerbate traffic congestion and increase the amount of spending on transportation costs, while the loss of workers can put strain on local economies.\n\nAnother important part of a diverse workforce are public sector jobs, like teachers and police officers. Affordable housing to these households can be the deciding factor for attracting an adequate and talented pool of public service workers that educate our children and keep our neighborhoods safe.\n\nThe table below shows the median annual wage for six common occupations with Chesterfield County government. These positions generally pay higher than the county's most prevalent private-sector jobs.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-public-sector .cell tbl-cap='Public sector occupations in Chesterfield County'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{l|r}\n\\hline\nOccupation & Median annual wage\\\\\n\\hline\nPlanners & \\$66,202\\\\\n\\hline\nPolice officers & \\$59,470\\\\\n\\hline\nCCPS teachers & \\$54,937\\\\\n\\hline\nFirefighters & \\$53,428\\\\\n\\hline\nEmergency communications officers & \\$44,166\\\\\n\\hline\nAdministrative workers & \\$44,115\\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{\\rule{0pt}{1em}\\textit{Source: } Chesterfield County.}\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUnderstanding the ability of a range of job types to afford housing in a county contributes to economic development goals and helps ensure that workers that live in the county can continue to live in the county. When people both live and work in a community, they are able to spend less time on the road and more time with their families and investing in their neighborhoods.\n\n## Homeowner affordability\n\nHomeownership is more difficult to achieve in Chesterfield County The COVID-19 pandemic further tightened the housing market across America, and the Richmond region was no exception. The low supply of homes-for-sale coupled with record low mortgage interest rates placed pressure on local housing markets, especially in the suburbs.\n\nThe median home sale price in Chesterfield County has increased by 39 percent since before the pandemic in 2019---from \\$269,000 to \\$371,480 in 2022 year-to-date.^[As of August 31, 2022.]\n\n\n::: {#fig-cf-med-sales .cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Source: CVR MLS. 2022 includes all sales through August 10, 2022.](part-1b-4_files/figure-pdf/fig-cf-med-sales-1.pdf){#fig-cf-med-sales}\n:::\n\nMedian single-family home sales price in Chesterfield County\n:::\n\n\nIn order to afford a home at this price, a household would need to make **\\$89,889** at the current average annual interest rate.^[Freddie Mac 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Annual Average as of August 31, 2022.] The table below shows the assumptions made to calculate this figure.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-cf-home-price .cell tbl-cap='Calculated income needed to buy median-priced home in Chesterfield County'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{l|r}\n\\hline\nVariable & Value\\\\\n\\hline\nMedian sales price & \\$371,480\\\\\n\\hline\nDownpayment & 5.0\\%\\\\\n\\hline\nClosing costs & 1.5\\%\\\\\n\\hline\nLoan amount & \\$358,280\\\\\n\\hline\nInterest rate & 4.65\\%\\\\\n\\hline\nMonthly utilities & \\$250\\\\\n\\hline\nMonthly payment & \\$2,097.42\\\\\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Income needed to buy home} & \\textbf{\\$89,889}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{\\rule{0pt}{1em}\\textit{Sources: } CVR MLS and Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey.}\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis minimum income is about \\$37,000 more than the 2020 median household income for renters in Chesterfield (\\$53,147).

Small landlords exiting the rental market and low supply are exacerbating the challenges renters were facing even before the pandemic.  For many renters in low paying jobs, the pandemic impacts were heightened for those that could not work-from-home and depended on shuttered service industry jobs. Slow wage growth and increasing rental prices combined to put pressure on the housing stability of essential workers.\n\nPost-recession average asking rent in the county hit a low of \\$1,207 in 2012 (adjusted to current dollars), but has been on the rise ever since. From 2012 to 2019, average rents rose an average of 0.5 percent each year until 2020, the year of the pandemic.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, average rent in the county rose by 4 percent (\\$61)---from \\$1,366 to \\$1,427, a substantial increase for individuals and families on tight budgets.
