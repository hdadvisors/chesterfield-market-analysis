When workers can’t find housing in a community, they either have to commute in or they search for work elsewhere. More in-commuters can exacerbate traffic congestion and increase the amount of spending on transportation costs, while the loss of workers can put strain on local economies.\n\nAnother important part of a diverse workforce are public sector jobs, like teachers and police officers. Affordable housing to these households can be the deciding factor for attracting an adequate and talented pool of public service workers that educate our children and keep our neighborhoods safe.\n\nThe table below shows the median annual wage for six common occupations with Chesterfield County government.
