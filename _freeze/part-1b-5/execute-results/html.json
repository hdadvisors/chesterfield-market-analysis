As the major north-south interstate corridor along the East Coast, American motorists stopped at the many motels and food stops that sustained a vibrant tourist economy.\n\nHowever, the creation of Interstate 95 in the late 1950s drew traffic, and with it business, away from the Route 1 corridor. Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, the corridor saw decline and significant changes that presented challenges for revitalization efforts.\n\nA growing Hispanic population along the corridor has helped reignite commercial activity along the corridor, but housing challenges still exist. Although one of the most affordable areas in Chesterfield County, the corridor has remained generally affordable due to older housing units---many of which are out of style and in need of significant rehabilitation.\n\n## Study area\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, the study area is defined as the Census tracts 1003, 1004.04, 1004.05, 1004.06, 1004.07, 1004.09. These tracts all border Route 1 from Northern Chesterfield to Route 10. This encompasses portions of the Bensley, Bellwood, and northern Chester neighborhoods.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {#fig-r1-base-map .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div

Thirty-seven percent of these units are located in a development with some rent restrictions that help ensure affordability. \n\nSince 2010, rents along the corridor have been on the rise, from a low of \\$1,108 in 2012 to a decade high of \\$1,225, when adjusting for inflation.

They often need to work additional hours, count on additional income from a partner, roommate, or family member, or compromise quality for affordability.\n\nThe majority of these properties are considered NOAH given their age, condition, and rent. But few, if any of these properties, have experienced any major renovations in the past decades---meaning that they are at-risk of deteriorating conditions or redevelopment. In either case, this puts residents in a precarious position: continue to live in unhealthy and unsafe conditions or move (voluntarily or involuntarily). \n\n## Takeaways\n\n* Many workers in the northern Route 1 corridor are part of the county's essential workforce. However, the jobs they hold command wages that are usually well below average.\n* Despite the lower home values in the study area, sales prices are rapidly increasing, putting homeownership out of reach for most residents of these neighborhoods.\n* Increasing rents will force current residents to absorb additional housing cost burden, or find cheaper options after making concessions about the location or quality of their home.",
