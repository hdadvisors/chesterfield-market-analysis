households experiencing cost burden has been in decline in recent years --- dropping 
from 45 percent in 2013 to 42 percent in 2018. But the actual number of cost-burdened 
renters has been on the rise --- from 10,495 at the start of the decade to 12,795

## Race/ethnicity

In the county, there are major disparities in cost burden between racial and ethnic 
groups. In 2018, the share of cost-burdened white households was ten percentage points 
lower than the share of Black, Asian, and Hispanic households.

In spite of these disparities, the share of cost burdened households of color has been 
in a steady decline. Most significantly, Hispanic households have experienced the greatest 
decrease in cost burden --- from nearly half of all Hispanic households in 2010 to only 
one in three (34 percent) in 2018. 

These decreases in cost burden among households of color may be in large part to the 
relative affordability and attractiveness of Chesterfield County to growing families.
