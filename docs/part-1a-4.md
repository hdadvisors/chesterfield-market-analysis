# Concentrations of affordable housing {#part-1a-4}

## Background

Concerns over the concentration of affordable housing have been largely born out of the criticisms of large-scale public housing developments and the impacts of concentrated poverty. But little research has been done on the impacts multiple affordable housing developments, such as Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, have on a community.

## Research analysis

Most relevant research on affordable housing concentration has been in regards to the impacts that an affordable housing development has on a community — mainly in terms of surrounding property value. According to recent research, the spillover effects of affordable housing developments have largely been conducted without regard to other nearby developments. Therefore, there is little to no consensus on what constitutes a concentration of affordable housing. 

Research conducted in 2008 on the spatial distribution of LIHTC properties determined that “clustering” of LIHTC properties does occur across metropolitan areas. However, the scale of clustering varied among metropolitan areas included in the study — none of which included the Richmond metropolitan area. This clustering was concluded to be due largely to program design (i.e. Qualified Allocation Plans in many states favor the development of LIHTC properties in Qualified Census Tracts (QCT) or Difficult Development Areas (DDA)).

In the same year, in A Review of Existing Research on the Effects of Federally Assisted Housing Programs on Neighboring Residential Property Values, Galster defined a concentration as either five or more properties within 1,000 to 2,000 feet of one another in Denver or three or more within 500 feet in Baltimore County. 

More recent research was conducted in 2020 on the spillover effects of more than one LIHTC property on surrounding homes. Once again, an explicit definition of a concentration of affordable housing was lacking. Voith and his colleagues simply differentiated between areas wherein there were zero, one, or two or more LIHTC developments within a half mile radius in Los Angeles City.

Based on this review, a concentration of affordable housing varies depending on research methods, as well as community context. In most instances, a concentration of affordable housing was described as being multiple properties within a set radius of one another. 

To this end, a concentration of affordable housing in Chesterfield County would look very different from a concentration of affordable housing in Hampton, Virginia or even in the City of Richmond.
