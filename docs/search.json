    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis report is currently in development. It was last updated on 2022-10-04.\n\n\nChesterfield County community revitalization staff seek additional information about current rental market dynamics, particularly along the county’s major commercial corridors. This report compiles and analyzes data on subsidized, market-affordable, and newly-built rental units to help strategically guide the county’s future community development investments using CDBG and other grant funds.\n\n\nThis report is divided into four parts:\nPART 1-A: LITERATURE REVIEW\nThis part summarizes recent and current public planning documents that guide Chesterfield’s housing strategies, provides distinctions between the different methods for measuring housing affordability, explores the definition of “naturally-occurring affordable housing” (NOAH), and assesses current research regarding the concentration of low-cost housing and differences in length-of-stay between homeowners and renters.\nPART 1-B: DEMOGRAPHIC AND AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS\nThis part provides insight into household incomes, housing cost burden, and housing affordability across Chesterfield County. Where possible, data is disaggregated by tenure, household type, age, and race/ethnicity. Data sources are identified and explained in the first chapter of this part, with special attention paid to reliability for datasets based on survey samples. The final chapter of this part is an affordability analysis for the Route 1 corridor within the county.\nPART 2-A: COUNTYWIDE MARKET ANALYSIS\nThis section summarizes the existing stock of rental units within the county and provides an analysis of recent price and production trends in the rental market. The second chapter conducts a spatial analysis of recent multifamily, market affordable, and affordable rental housing in the county. The third chapter is a market comparison between recent multifamily (built in the last five years or slated for future construction) development and existing rental supply in the county. The final chapter summarizes in-depth interviews with nonprofit and for-profit multifamily developers in the county.\nPART 2-B: CORRIDOR CASE STUDIES\nThis section provides a market and spatial analysis of multifamily developments along two major corridors in the county: the Route One Corridor from the city-county line to Route 10 and the Eastern Hull Street Corridor from the city-county border to Genito Road."

    "section": "2.2 30 percent standard",
    "text": "2.2 30 percent standard\nA household spending more than 30 percent of their gross income on housing costs is often referred to as cost-burdened. This standard (and the term “cost burden”) is the most commonly used benchmark for housing affordability. It is simple to understand, and simple to calculate, because only two data points are needed: gross household income and total housing costs.\nThe 30 percent threshold is used because any income used for housing beyond that share cannot be used for transportation, healthcare, childcare, groceries, and other necessary household expenses. Generally speaking, a cost-burdened household will more commonly have trouble balancing their monthly budget, and will also face significant challenges when attempting to save or invest their income.\nThis income-to-cost ratio was originally set at 25 percent when the federal government began designing housing assistance programs in the 1960s and 1970s. The threshold was increased to 30 percent in the 1980s. Today, the 30 percent cap is used to set household rent levels for public housing, Housing Choice Vouchers, and many other housing assistance initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawbacks of 30 percent standard\n\n\n\nAlthough it has been the go-to measure in housing affordability, the 30 percent standard has several criticisms. Chief among these critiques is that living expenses vary from household to household.2 A family of four will likely face much higher and additional costs for things like childcare, food, and transportation, when compared to a single adult with the same income.\nSecondly, different income groups don’t spend the same way.3 Higher income households can have much more flexibility to spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs when compared to a low income household. Using the 30 percent standard in this case can sometimes overestimate the share of higher income households experiencing cost burden.\nOther critics also reference the fact that the 30 percent standard does not account for things like location and housing quality. A household living in a very walkable community will spend very differently from a household that has to invest a lot of money in transportation (i.e., gas and car maintenance).\n\n\nCost burden data is available from the U.S. Census Bureau in the American Community Survey. Tables B25091 and B25070 break down the share of gross household income dedicated to housing costs for homeowners and renters, respectively.\nTable B25091 defines “selected monthly owner costs” for homeowners as:\n\nMonthly mortgage payments,\nReal estate taxes,\nHomeowners and/or mortgage insurance, and\nNecessary utilities.\n\nTable B25070 defines “gross rent” for renters as:\n\nMonthly contract rent payments, and\nNecessary utilities paid directly by tenants.\n\nIn Chesterfield County:\nThe table below combines those datasets to show the number of cost burdened households by tenure in Chesterfield County.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1:  Cost burden by tenure in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Cost burden \n    Homeowners \n    Renters \n    Total \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Not cost burdened \n    78,661 \n    15,005 \n    93,666 \n    73.6% \n  \n  \n    Cost burdened \n    18,502 \n    13,266 \n    31,768 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    Not computed \n    427 \n    1,369 \n    1,796 \n    1.4% \n  \n  \n    Total \n    97,590 \n    29,640 \n    127,230 \n    100.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2016-2020 5-year estimates.

This reflects the median family income being about 1.5 times greater than the minimum income required to purchase the median priced home, using the current 30-year fixed mortgage rate published by the Federal Housing Finance Board. A higher HAI value reflects higher affordability in the for-sale market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on NAR’s HAI\n\n\n\nThe full Housing Affordability Index methodology is available on the NAR website.\n\n\nThe HAI has steadily decreased as housing prices continue to rise across the nation. As of June 2022, the preliminary HAI for all 50 states was 98.5. This assumed a median single-family home price of $423,300, a mortgage rate of 5.60%, and a median family income of $91,952.\nIn Chesterfield County:\nThe table below shows the inputs and calculated HAI for Chesterfield County as of August 2022. The median sales price is collected from all 2022 year-to-date single-family home sales accessed from the Central Virginia Regional Multiple Listing Service (CVR MLS).4 The 30-year fixed mortgage is sourced from the national weekly average published by the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey for the week ending September 1, 2022. The median family income is the latest value published by the U.S. Census Bureau.5\nThe current HAI for Chesterfield County is 118.8.

    "text": "2.4 NLIHC’s Housing Wage\nThe National Low Income Housing Coalition has published its Out of Reach report every year since 1989 to bring attention to the widening gap between actual wages and the cost of rental housing in the United States. Within this report, NLIHC calculates its Housing Wage, an affordability measure that estimates the wage a full-time worker must earn to afford rental housing based on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) fair market rent (FMR) without spending more than 30 percent of their income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on NLIHC’s Out of Reach\n\n\n\nThe latest 2022 Out of Reach report and data is available on the NLIHC website.\n\n\nNLIHC utilizes multiple data sources, such as the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and average wages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to create an affordability measure that focuses on the economic gap between household incomes and the price of rental housing.\nFair market rent is another a key statistic that helps NLIHC determine the Housing Wage. FMR is calculated by HUD every fiscal year and is a reflection of the median rent in a given area. FMR is largely used to set rental assistance limits under the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program (Section 8).\nThere have been few, if any, specific critiques of the Housing Wage statistic. But issue can be taken with the fact that FMR is set at the metropolitan level. Therefore, the FMR in Chesterfield County, regardless of location, is the same as the FMR in the City of Richmond and other localities in the Richmond, Virginia Metropolitan Statistican Area (MSA). This means that the Housing Wage does not fully account for the nuances that exist across the regional rental market.\nWhile the Housing Wage is helpful in determining the relationship between jobs and housing prices, it does not help to measure the gap in affordable housing, or rather how many households are facing affordability challenges.\nIn Chesterfield County:\nNLIHC released their latest Out of Reach report in July 2022. According to NLIHC, the annual wage required to afford a two-bedroom rental unit in Chesterfield County was $47,560, or an hourly wage of $22.87. NLIHC estimates that the typical renter wage in Chesterfield County is $17.15—nearly $6 short of the wage needed to afford a typical two-bedroom rental in the region."

    "text": "2.5 CNT’s H+T Affordability Index\nThe Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT) developed the Housing + Transportation (H+T) Affordability Index in 2006 as a result of a Minneapolis-St. Paul report conducted for the Brookings Institution’s Urban Markets Initiative. This affordability measure is a robust indicator of the role that geographic location has on the two major costs faced by American households: housing and transportation.\nCNT expands on the 30 percent standard with the inclusion of transportation costs in an affordability standard. Based on extensive research CNT found that 15 percent was a reasonable standard at which to set affordable transportation costs; it follows that a household should pay no more than 45 percent of their household income on housing and transportation costs combined.\nCNT’s transportation cost model takes into account several factors that influence how much a typical household pays for transportation, including commuting data, public transportation access, housing density, and consumer behavior.\nWith the H+T Affordability Index, CNT offers detailed data down to the Census Block Group-level (i.e. a neighborhood-level). The index is provided in terms of a regional typical household based on a median income, the average number of commuters per household, and the average household size. This allows the index to consistently measure the impact of neighborhood factors on a typical household’s housing and transportation costs.\nThe index is expressed as a set percentage of income—in other words, what the typical regional household spends on housing and transportation based on their home’s location.\nIn spite of the H+T’s comprehensiveness, it has its pitfalls. The nature of the model requires the use of a standard household which only sets a baseline from which to compare other households to. This can make it difficult to make conclusions about households with incomes lower or higher than that baseline. To help with this, CNT offers the index based on a regional moderate income household—80 percent of the regional median household income, while maintaining the typical regional household size and commuters.\nThe index also suffers from outdated data sources. The most recent update of the model took place in 2017 and utilized data that predated this year to calculate the index. Therefore, the index does not capture recent trends in housing and transportation costs that tend to exacerbate cost burden.\nIn Chesterfield County:\nThe most recent H+T Affordability Index for Chesterfield County stated that the typical regional household, with an income of $59,919, 1.19 commuters per household, and a household size of 2.58 people, spent 53 percent of their income on housing and transportation combined.\nCNT disaggregated housing and transportation to account for 30 percent and 23 percent, respectively.\nThese costs increase for the regional moderate income household with an income of $47,935—increasing to 63 percent, or 38 percent on housing and 25 percent on transportation."

That residual amount can then be compared to local housing prices to assess affordability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on the residual income approach\n\n\n\nThe most comprehensive assessment of the residual income approach compared to other housing affordability measures is Measuring Housing Affordability: Assessing the 30 Percent of Income Standard, a research paper published by The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies in 2018.\n\n\nBenefits of the residual income approach include the ability to:\n\nFactor in real-life household cost estimates for transportation, healthcare, and other necessary expenses,\nAccount for a range of household types and compositions, particularly those with children, and\nMore accurately reflect the affordability distinctions between low and high income households.\n\nHowever, drawbacks of this metric include:\n\nGreater data and methodological requirements, making it less accessible to calculate,\nDifficulty in providing a simple explanation of the methods to laypersons, and\nThe potential to inflate affordability challenges in high-cost areas.\n\nIn Chesterfield County:\nA full calculation of housing affordability in Chesterfield County using the residual income method is beyond the scope of this report. However, we may use a sample from the Self-Sufficiency Standard (SSS) dataset published by the Center for Women’s Welfare at the University of Washington. According to the Center, this Standard:\n\n…defines the income working families need to meet a minimum yet adequate level, taking into account family composition, ages of children, and geographic differences in costs. The Standard is an affordability and living wage economic security measure that provides an alternative to the official poverty measure.\n\nAs an example, we will estimate residual income for a household with the following characteristics:\n\nTwo full-time working adults (married) and two elementary school-age children,\nA total household income equal to 80 percent of the Richmond, Virginia Area Median Income (AMI), and\nFull-time residency in Chesterfield County.\n\nFirst, we calculate the gross and take-home household incomes. According to HUD’s FY 2021 Income Limits, the income for a four-person family at 80 percent AMI is $72,000. Based on current federal and state effective tax rates, the estimated total household income after taxes for this family would be $58,111. This amounts to a monthly take-home wage of $4,843.\nNext, we determine the 2021 SSS monthly cost estimates for a four-person household with two working adults and two elementary school-age children in Chesterfield County. These total costs (housing excluded) are $4,480.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.3:  Self-Sufficiency Standard monthly costs \n \n  \n    Expense \n    Amount \n  \n \n\n  \n    Child Care \n    $1,086 \n  \n  \n    Food \n    $922 \n  \n  \n    Transportation \n    $576 \n  \n  \n    Health Care \n    $775 \n  \n  \n    Miscellaneous \n    $462 \n  \n  \n    Taxes \n    $1,092 \n  \n  \n    Child Care Tax Credit (-) \n    ($100) \n  \n  \n    Child Tax Credit (-) \n    ($333) \n  \n  \n    Total \n    $4,480 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then subtract these costs from the total take home pay of each household to determine what is left to be spent on housing costs.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.4:  Residual income available for housing for family of four at 80 percent AMI \n \n  \n    Pay, expenses, and residual income \n    Amount \n  \n \n\n  \n    Monthly take-home pay \n    $4,843 \n  \n  \n    Monthly expenses (-) \n    ($4,480) \n  \n  \n    Residual income \n    $363 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis $363 available for housing is far below than the required monthly payment to afford the median-priced single-family home ($1,717, from HAI section above) and the market rent for apartments with three or more bedrooms ($1,759, via CoStar6) in Chesterfield County.\nFor additional examples, we can estimate residual income for some of the county’s most common household types and incomes7:\nHomeowners\n\nMarried registered nurse and Chesterfield County police officer, with two school-age kids, and a household income of $136,410\nMarried couple, aged 65 and over, with no kids, and a monthly Social Security benefit of $2,739.10 (average amount for retired worker and aged spouse)\n\nRenters\n\nSingle Chesterfield County Public Schools teacher, with no kids, and a household income of $54,937\nSingle female home health aide, with an infant and preschooler, and a household income of $23,930\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the monthly take home pay for each of these households, along with their calculated residual incomes based on SSS cost estimates.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.5:  Monthly take home pay and residual income for selected households \n \n  \n    Household \n    Take home pay \n    Residual income \n  \n \n\n  \n    Registered nurse, police officer, 2 kids \n    $8,594.58 \n    $5,206.02 \n  \n  \n    CCPS teacher \n    $3,589.33 \n    $2,618.01 \n  \n  \n    Retired senior and spouse \n    $2,328.24 \n    $250.94 \n  \n  \n    Home health aide, 2 kids \n    $1,685.92 \n    -$2,000.74 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese cases show a wide range of housing affordability depended on income and assumed households expenses. For two-earner families with above-average salaries, finding a home to buy in the county is likely not a major challenge. For single workers with strong wages, finding an affordable apartment in Chesterfield may not be difficult. However, student loans, car payments, and other possible debt—not included in this analysis—would change this outcome.\nOn the other hand, lower income families—especially those with greater expenses associated with young children—must make hard choices to balance their budget. These concessions may include forgoing healthier (and more expensive) food options, putting off necessary healthcare treatments, and finding cheaper housing that is further away from their jobs. Other forms of public assistance, such as EBT, would also help."

Widely referred to as naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH), or market-affordable housing, these properties are a growing concern for communities facing housing affordability challenges.\nThe preservation of NOAH properties has been a growing strategy to support affordable housing in communities as the ability to quickly develop new units has been stifled by labor shortages, rising land prices, and supply chain issues. NOAH is at great risk of being lost because it often requires greater investment to maintain and more likely to be redeveloped—in turn contributing to a loss of affordable housing units."

    "text": "3.2 Defining NOAH\nWhile research around NOAH has been growing over the past several years, an universally-accepted definition still does not exist. But general agreement among advocates and practitioners is that NOAH units are older, outmoded, and in less desirable locations.\nWhen these characteristics are placed into the context of a community’s rental market, rents are generally lower than the typical rental unit because NOAH units are of comparably lower quality than newer units on the market.\nCoStar, a commercial real estate and analytics provider with its global research operations based in Richmond, Virginia, conducted an analysis of NOAH properties in Fall 2016 at the request of Urban Land Institute’s Terwilliger Center for Housing.\nThis analysis concluded that 76 percent of the 335,978 multifamily properties in their database were NOAH properties. CoStar came to this conclusion based on their proprietary rating system, which gives each property a star rating from one to five stars, wherein one- and two-star properties are the equivalent of Class B and C properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are Class B and C properties?\n\n\n\nThe commercial real estate industry utilizes a property classification system to help investors, lenders, and brokers quickly understand and communicate the quality of a property. The system classifies real estate properties as A, B, C, or D.\nNOAH properties generally fall into either Class B or C.\nClass B\nThese properties are generally in good condition for being built within the last 20 years, but the exteriors and interiors are generally considered outdated. Amenities are much less than those found in a high end apartment. Renovations may have occurred recently and there is little deferred maintenance.\nClass C\nThese properties were built within the last 30 years or are a much older property that has had recent renovations. Exteriors and interiors are outdated, and amenities are very limited. Improvements to the property show some age and there may be some deferred maintenance."

However, the CoStar database does not fully capture all of these communities.\nIn 2016, the Manufactured Home Community Coalition of Virginia (MHCCV) conducted a study of mobile home parks in Central Virginia and found that Chesterfield County was home to roughly 1,500 units within parks—the highest of any Central Virginia locality, with the second highest locality being Prince George at 831.\nThe analysis below includes all manufactured home communities in Chesterfield County identified in the MHCCV report. They are appended to the CoStar records to create a fuller NOAH dataset. However, the only known variables are property location and number of units within each park. Accurate rent levels for most of these communities are not known at this time.\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Amount\nChesterfield County is home to 5,155 market-affordable rental units as of August 2022. These apartments are predominately in garden-style buildings with 200 to 250 units per property. A smaller share of these NOAH units are found in manufactured home communities and low-rise multifamily buildings.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1:  NOAH properties and units by style \n \n  \n    Style \n    Properties \n    Units \n  \n \n\n  \n    Garden \n    19 \n    3,548 \n  \n  \n    Manufactured Home Community \n    13 \n    1,491 \n  \n  \n    Low-Rise \n    4 \n    116 \n  \n  \n    Total \n    36 \n    5,155 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: CoStar Group, Inc.\nThis NOAH inventory is approximately 16 percent of the county’s total number of rental units according to the latest Census Bureau estimates.2 However, that estimate includes the approximately 10,000 single-family homes leased out in Chesterfield.\n\n\n3.3.2 Location\nNOAH properties are spread throughout all parts of Chesterfield County, but like most NOAH properties nationwide, they are largely located in the inner suburbs—areas that saw early development towards the middle of the 19th century. These includes garden style apartments like Falling Creek Apartments along Route One or manufactured home communities like Suburban Village off of Midlothian Turnpike.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Location and type of NOAH\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Rent levels\nAs of early 2022, average rents in Chesterfield’s NOAH units range from $744 to $1,491 depending on the number of bedrooms. The minimum gross annual income to afford the average 2-bedroom market-affordable apartment is $47,560.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2:  Current rent by bedroom in NOAH properties \n \n  \n    Bedrooms \n    Rent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Studio \n    $744 \n  \n  \n    1 Bed \n    $1,023 \n  \n  \n    2 Beds \n    $1,189 \n  \n  \n    3 Beds \n    $1,491 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: CoStar Group, Inc.\nMarket rents in Chesterfield’s NOAH units have increased significantly as demand for lower-cost apartments continues to exceed the supply.

    "text": "4.2 Research analysis\n\n4.2.1 Defining “concentration”\nMost relevant research on affordable housing concentration focused on the economic impacts that an affordable housing development has on a community—mainly in terms of surrounding property value. According to recent research, the spillover effects of affordable housing developments have largely been conducted without regard to the presence or absence of other nearby developments.1 Therefore, there is little to no consensus on what constitutes a concentration of affordable housing.\nResearch conducted in 2008 on the spatial distribution of LIHTC properties determined that “clustering” of LIHTC properties does occur across metropolitan areas.2 However, the scale of clustering varied among metropolitan areas included in the study—none of which included the Richmond metropolitan area. This clustering was found to primarily the result of program design (i.e. Qualified Allocation Plans in many states favor the development of LIHTC properties in Qualified Census Tracts (QCT) or Difficult Development Areas (DDA)).\n\n\n4.2.2 Community impacts from affordable housing\nIn 2008, a report from the National Association of REALTORS® defined concentrations of assisted rental properties differently across metro areas.3 For example, five or more properties within 1,000 to 2,000 feet of one another is a concentration in Denver, compared to or three or more properties within 500 feet in Baltimore County. Attempting to determine any effect these concentrations had on property values, the author finds:\n\n[That there] appears to be no consistent impact of federally assisted housing on nearby residential property values; impacts are contingent on context, concentration, and scale.\n\nMore recent research from 2020 investigated spillover effects of more than one LIHTC property on surrounding homes in the City of Los Angeles.4 Once again, an explicit definition of a concentration of affordable housing could not be confidently stated. Authors instead differentiated between areas wherein there were zero, one, or two or more LIHTC developments within a half mile radius. Again investigating the impact on property values, the report finds:\n\nLIHTC properties positively impact surrounding housing values across the spectrum of Los Angeles’ neighborhoods. Further the concentration of multiple LIHTC properties in a neighborhood additively increases housing prices up to ½ mile away. Finally, these effects though of greater magnitude in lower-income neighborhoods, are fully present in high-income neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs-housing balance\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Center for Urban and Regional Analysis at Virginia Commonwealth University released a report on the jobs-housing imbalance in the Richmond region. While it did not specifically address any potential “concentrations” of affordable housing, it analyzed six low-cost rental housing developments to determine if they had any tangible impacts to the surrounding neighborhoods.\nThe analysis, which included two properties in Chesterfield County (one subsidized and one unsubsidized), determined that these developments likely had no influence on nearby property values, property sales, or crime rates.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Summary\nBased on this review, a concentration of affordable housing varies depending on research methods, as well as community context. In most instances, a concentration of affordable housing was described as being multiple properties within a set radius of one another. To this end, a concentration of affordable housing in Chesterfield County would look very different from a concentration of affordable housing in Hampton, Virginia or even in the City of Richmond.\nFurthermore, research shows that the most common concerns about affordable housing’s impact to the nearby community are not substantiated. Any claims that a new affordable housing development would have significant negative consequences on its surroundings (measured in particular by property values and crime rates) are generally unfounded."

However, we use public and private datasets to plot both subsidized and market-affordable rental properties across the county in the sections below.\n\n4.3.1 With public subsidy\nBased on data from the National Housing Preservation Database (NHPD), affordable housing properties supported by the federal government are spread throughout the suburban parts of the county. There are 32 federally assisted properties in Chesterfield County, compared to 60 in Henrico County and 134 in the City of Richmond. In Chesterfield, the majority of assisted units are supported by the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, where market-rate units are often included in the development.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Federally assisted rental properties in Chesterfield County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Federally assisted units by subsidy type in Chesterfield County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Without public subsidy\nNaturally-occurring affordable housing (NOAH) is much more prevalent across the county than its income-restricted counterparts, as discussed in Chapter 3. These properties can be found throughout most populated areas, with the highest concentrations within several miles of the border with the City of Richmond, particularly between Hull Street and Route 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Location and type of NOAH\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Housing Choice Vouchers\nThe Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program is the federal government’s main program for assisting very low-income families, elderly, and disabled persons afford housing. Vouchers provide rental assistance to help individuals and families that make no more than 50 percent AMI find housing in the private market. Voucher holders are able to choose where they want to live, but the property must meet Section 8 requirements (i.e. meet health, safety, and proper maintenance requirements).\nTenants are required to 30 percent of their monthly adjusted gross income on rent and utilities, while the voucher will cover the remaining amount up to a payment standard set by HUD. This payment standard is referred to as Fair Market Rent (FMR), a measure of the average cost of affordable housing in a metropolitan area. For county residents, HCVs are administered through the county’s Department of Social Services (as a local housing agency on behalf of Virginia Housing). HCV recipients from other agencies in the region, such as Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority, are able to utilize their vouchers in Chesterfield County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFair Market Rent\n\n\n\nIn the Richmond region, the FMR for a two-bedroom rental in 2021 was $1,189.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: HCV utilization in Chesterfield County\n\n\n\nIn the county, there were 930 HCVs in use as of February 15, 2022. The map above shows the spatial concentration of HCVs as a percentage of total renter-occupied housing units. HCVs are largely concentrated in the county’s more densely populated areas where there are multifamily housing options. Areas wherein at least one in four renter households utilize vouchers are located in the northern section of Route 1, along the Chippenham Parkway, and south towards Ettrick."

    "text": "5.1 Research analysis\nFrom a growing family to a change in employment, the length of time a person rents an apartment or home can vary depending on a multitude of factors. Little academic research has been conducted on the length of stay among market-rate renters. Most research conducted in this area is dedicated to better understanding apartment turnover rates from a commercial real estate perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch limitations\n\n\n\nTo date, no formal research has been conducted making comparisons between market-rate and affordable housing resident length of stay.\n\n\nFor affordable housing residents, the most comprehensive study of length of stay was conducted in 2017 by the HUD’s Office of Policy Development and Research.1 The report found that stays in affordable housing varied by program type. Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program participants had a median stay of 4.8 years, while programs like public housing and Section 8 project-based programs had a median stay closer to market rate residents—three years.\nLIHTC, a major source of affordable housing across the nation, was missing from this study, and no research was found to be conducted on LITHC tenant length of stay. However, Section 8 project-based assistance and HCVs are often tied to LIHTC units.\nPDR notes that stays in affordable housing programs are likely to increase as market forces, such as rising home prices and stagnant wages, continue to negatively impact low-income households. This increased length of stay in affordable housing can prevent new residents from accessing a much needed resource when additional supply is not being generated. It can also be an indication of residents not being able to climb the economic ladder to move out of assisted housing.\nGeneral consensus on market-rate rental housing tenancy ranges depending on whether a property is single-family or multifamily. Single-family rental stays average three years, while stays in multifamily properties averages about 27.5 months.2 Affordable housing stays average higher at nearly six years, but can vary depending on household type. Senior households stay about nine years, while non-senior families with children stay about four years.\nFor the private market, it can be beneficial to increase tenant length of stay. Tenant turnover can be costly for landlords who need to clean, repair, and market rental units. Vacancy, for any amount of time, equates to lost rent."

For example, that the risk of “unmasking” private data has been greatly overstated, and that the added noise makes neighborhood-level data very unreliable for research.\nFurthermore, there is evidence that the 2020 Census dramatically undercounted Americans who are Black, Latino, or indigenous. This is attributable to both the impact of COVID-19 on response rates, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s effort to add citizenship status as an additional question for respondents to answer."

This feature allows researchers and policymakers to easily compare housing needs with available housing programs, which nearly always use AMI for eligibility guidelines.\nCHAS data is produced using ACS 5-year estimates and lags behind 5-year estimate releases by a year. Therefore, the most recent release of CHAS data (as of March 2022) is for the 2014-2018 5-year period.\nPublished CHAS data does include calculated margins of error based on the original ACS sample. These error ranges generally result in high to moderate estimate reliability at the locality level (especially for larger jurisdictions, such as Chesterfield County). However, we take caution in using CHAS data produced for small population subsets with higher errors (e.g., households who rent, are between 30 and 50 percent AMI, are Asian, and are cost-burdened)."

The increase in households who rent can be attributed to the growing cost of homeownership in the county, as well as changing preferences among individuals and families.\nAs of 2020, the median household income for renters is nearly half (55 percent) that of the typical homeowner’s household income: $53,147 compared to $96,296. When adjusted for inflation, the median renter income has risen slightly over the past decade (by just under $4,000). This is likely in part due to some middle-income households delaying homeownership because of limited affordable inventory and, for some young working adults, burdensome student loan debt.\nAt the same time, average homeowner incomes have actually declined slightly (by just over $1,000). One potential explanation for the limited income growth among homeowners is the ongoing transition from full employment to fixed income for baby boomers entering retirement.\nBecause real average incomes for both homeowners and renters in Chesterfield County have remained steady for a decade, a wide gap of more than $43,000 remains.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Median household income by tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following graph shows the distribution of households incomes by tenure, for both 2010 and 2020. The Census Bureau does not adjust these income ranges for inflation, so 2010 incomes are in 2010 dollars. Both homeowners and renters experienced upward shifts in their nominal incomes, with significant growth in households earning $100,000 or more annually.

This is evident in Chesterfield County, where households both under 25 and 65 and older have substantially lower average incomes.\nThe 45 to 64 year age group had a high median household income nearing $100,000 in 2020. This age group represents a significant number of Generation X’ers and baby boomers in their prime working years who have chosen to live in the county. Millennial households in the county—those 25 to 44 years old—also have high incomes ($87,328).\nChesterfield seniors in 2020 had a median household income of $61,777. Although this was the only age group to see a moderate increase (11 percent) in median household income, senior incomes are still significantly lower than their other adult counterparts. This translates to less income to compete for housing in the Chesterfield market.\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, households under 25 have seen decreasing incomes—going from $48,591 in 2010 to $40,881 in 2020, a 16 percent decrease. Lower incomes among Generation Z may have major implications on the need for more rental and starter home options amid rising costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Median household income by age"

However, this increase occurred almost entirely from 2019 to 2020, which is likely reflective of additional individuals and households choosing to identify with more than one race or ethnicity than they would have in previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent trends in self-reported demographic identity\n\n\n\nThe significant rise in income for multiracial households is very likely in part because of the changing ways Americans are choosing to identify their race and ethnicity.\n\n\nThe lowest average incomes in the county are found among Hispanic and Black households; both groups have also not seen significant changes in real incomes since 2010. Black households had a median income of $71,962 in 2020, while Hispanic households had a median income of $60,875.

Households spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs are housing cost-burdened, while households spending more than 50 percent are severely housing cost-burdened. Although cost burden can be a reflection of insufficient wages to afford housing, it can also point to a growing need for more diverse housing options.\nWhile other measures have their benefits in communicating the need to address housing affordability (Chapter 2), the 30 percent standard has not only been shown to be accurate in representing the overall community, but it can be easily understood and applied at different scales. For these reasons, and for the range of demographic and socioeconomic crosstabs available for cost burden in CHAS data, we use this standard."

The total share of cost-burdened homeowners has shrunk, from nearly one in four (24 percent) in 2010 to 18 percent in 2018.\nBut cost burden is still substantial among households with lower incomes, especially extremely low- (30 percent AMI or less) and very low-income (31 to 50 percent AMI) homeowners, where over half of homeowners at these incomes are cost-burdened, 85 percent and 56 percent, respectively. Worse yet, the majority of cost burdened homeowners at these incomes are spending more than 50 percent of their income on housing costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Homeowner cost burden\n\n\n\n\nWith the share of renters increasing in Chesterfield County, the share of renter households experiencing cost burden has been in decline in recent years—dropping from 45 percent in 2013 to 42 percent in 2018.

Income groups making less than 80 percent AMI have seen an increasing share of cost-burdened renters. Those increases have been greatest among extremely low-income renters (85 percent to 90 percent) and low-income renters (58 percent to 64 percent) between 2012 and 2018.

In 2018, 5,885 elderly non-family households (42 percent) were cost-burdened—higher than any other household type. The brunt of this cost burden was shouldered by homeowners (3,730), but 69 percent of seniors living alone (2,155) who rent were cost-burdened, indicating a clear need to address senior affordable rental housing in the county.\nThe second household type experiencing a significant amount of cost burden (35 percent) was non-elderly non-family households (i.e., single adults living alone, or with a roommate). Although decreasing eight percentage points since 2012, a large share of single adults were still cost-burdened—from 8,455 to 6,595 households.

There are diverse job opportunities across the region, and while some common jobs do pay well-above minimum wage, housing costs are rising faster.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.1:  Top five most common occupations in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Occupation \n    Jobs \n    Mean hourly wage \n    Mean annual wage \n  \n \n\n  \n    Retail salespersons \n    18,770 \n    $13.85 \n    $28,800 \n  \n  \n    Fast food and counter workers \n    16,930 \n    $11.29 \n    $23,490 \n  \n  \n    Customer service representatives \n    13,560 \n    $17.51 \n    $36,410 \n  \n  \n    Registered nurses \n    12,910 \n    $36.99 \n    $76,940 \n  \n  \n    Home health and personal care aides \n    9,390 \n    $11.51 \n    $23,930 \n  \n\n\nSources:   Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, May 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nA diverse workforce also requires diverse housing for those workers. When workers can’t find housing in a community, they either have to commute in or they search for work elsewhere. More in-commuters can exacerbate traffic congestion and increase the amount of spending on transportation costs, while the loss of workers can put strain on local economies.\nAnother important part of a diverse workforce are public sector jobs, like teachers and police officers. Affordable housing to these households can be the deciding factor for attracting an adequate and talented pool of public service workers that educate our children and keep our neighborhoods safe.\nThe table below shows the median annual wage for six common occupations with Chesterfield County government. These positions generally pay higher than the county’s most prevalent private-sector jobs.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.2:  Public sector occupations in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Occupation \n    Median annual wage \n  \n \n\n  \n    Planners \n    $66,202 \n  \n  \n    Police officers \n    $59,470 \n  \n  \n    CCPS teachers \n    $54,937 \n  \n  \n    Firefighters \n    $53,428 \n  \n  \n    Emergency communications officers \n    $44,166 \n  \n  \n    Administrative workers \n    $44,115 \n  \n\n\nSource:   Chesterfield County.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the ability of a range of job types to afford housing in a county contributes to economic development goals and helps ensure that workers that live in the county can continue to live in the county. When people both live and work in a community, they are able to spend less time on the road and more time with their families and investing in their neighborhoods."

    "text": "9.2 Homeowner affordability\nHomeownership is more difficult to achieve in Chesterfield County The COVID-19 pandemic further tightened the housing market across America, and the Richmond region was no exception. The low supply of homes-for-sale coupled with record low mortgage interest rates placed pressure on local housing markets, especially in the suburbs.\nThe median home sale price in Chesterfield County has increased by 39 percent since before the pandemic in 2019—from $269,000 to $371,480 in 2022 year-to-date.1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Median single-family home sales price in Chesterfield County\n\n\n\n\nIn order to afford a home at this price, a household would need to make $89,889 at the current average annual interest rate.2 The table below shows the assumptions made to calculate this figure.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.3:  Calculated income needed to buy median-priced home in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Variable \n    Value \n  \n \n\n  \n    Median sales price \n    $371,480 \n  \n  \n    Downpayment \n    5.0% \n  \n  \n    Closing costs \n    1.5% \n  \n  \n    Loan amount \n    $358,280 \n  \n  \n    Interest rate \n    4.65% \n  \n  \n    Monthly utilities \n    $250 \n  \n  \n    Monthly payment \n    $2,097.42 \n  \n  \n    Income needed to buy home \n    $89,889 \n  \n\n\nSources:   CVR MLS and Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis minimum income is about $37,000 more than the 2020 median household income for renters in Chesterfield ($53,147). In fact, through 2020, the average renter household income is unable to support a home sales price above $250,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Median household income and affordable home sales price for renters in Chesterfield County\n\n\n\n\nCompared to 2021 average wages, several common occupations in the county would also struggle to afford the typical home price in the county in 2021. For example, customer service representatives average hourly wage of $17.51 could only afford a monthly mortgage payment for a home priced below $170,000. Even with an hourly wage that is three times that of the Virginia minimum wage ($11.00 per hour), households in the county would still struggle to afford a home.\nThe table below shows the maximum home sales price affordable at the current average wages for the five most common occupations in Chesterfield County.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.4:  Maximum home sales price for five most common occupations in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Occupation \n    Jobs \n    Maximum home sales price \n  \n \n\n  \n    Retail salespersons \n    18,770 \n    $130,324 \n  \n  \n    Fast food and counter workers \n    16,930 \n    $106,296 \n  \n  \n    Customer service representatives \n    13,560 \n    $164,761 \n  \n  \n    Registered nurses \n    12,910 \n    $348,165 \n  \n  \n    Home health and personal care aides \n    9,390 \n    $108,287 \n  \n\n\nSources:   Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey and Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, May 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong public sector employees working for the county, maximum home sales prices are higher, reflecting the stronger wages they command. However, most of these prices are at or below $300,000, still well under the county’s current median sales price of $371,480.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.5:  Maximum home sales price for public sector occupations in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Occupation \n    Maximum home sales price \n  \n \n\n  \n    Planners \n    $299,574 \n  \n  \n    Police officers \n    $269,111 \n  \n  \n    CCPS teachers \n    $248,598 \n  \n  \n    Firefighters \n    $241,770 \n  \n  \n    Emergency communications officers \n    $199,858 \n  \n  \n    Administrative workers \n    $199,627 \n  \n\n\nSources:   Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey and Chesterfield County."

    "text": "9.3 Renter affordability\nThe housing supply shortage is also being felt in the rental housing market. Small landlords exiting the rental market and low supply are exacerbating the challenges renters were facing even before the pandemic. For many renters in low paying jobs, the pandemic impacts were heightened for those that could not work-from-home and depended on shuttered service industry jobs. Slow wage growth and increasing rental prices combined to put pressure on the housing stability of essential workers.\nPost-recession average asking rent in the county hit a low of $1,207 in 2012 (adjusted to current dollars), but has been on the rise ever since. From 2012 to 2019, average rents rose an average of 0.5 percent each year until 2020, the year of the pandemic.\nBetween 2019 and 2020, average rent in the county rose by 4 percent ($61)—from $1,366 to $1,427, a substantial increase for individuals and families on tight budgets. Today, the average rent in the county is around $1,500.3\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Average asking rent in Chesterfield County: 2000 Q1 to 2022 Q2\n\n\n\n\nCurrent minimum annual incomes needed to afford the average apartment in the county—without becoming cost-burdened—start around $52,000 for a 1 bedroom unit. Two bedroom apartments rent at right about the overall average, requiring at least $59,560. Three bedrooms units command a much higher premium over $1,700 per month. Renters looking for these larger units will need an income of $68,320 or more to budget comfortably.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.6:  Calculated income needed to afford average rents by bedroom in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Bedrooms \n    Average rent \n    Income needed \n  \n \n\n  \n    1 bedroom \n    $1,301 \n    $52,040 \n  \n  \n    2 bedrooms \n    $1,489 \n    $59,560 \n  \n  \n    3 bedrooms \n    $1,708 \n    $68,320 \n  \n  \n    All apartments \n    $1,499 \n    $59,960 \n  \n\n\nSource:   CoStar Group, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis rent is increasingly unaffordable to some of the most common occupations in the county, like retail salespersons and home health aides. For a retail salesperson with an average hourly wage of $13.85, a rent on a single income would be more affordable at $672 to $748 cheaper than the typical rent in the county.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.7:  Maximum monthly rent for five most common occupations in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Occupation \n    Jobs \n    Maximum monthly rent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Retail salespersons \n    18,770 \n    $720.00 \n  \n  \n    Fast food and counter workers \n    16,930 \n    $587.25 \n  \n  \n    Customer service representatives \n    13,560 \n    $910.25 \n  \n  \n    Registered nurses \n    12,910 \n    $1,923.50 \n  \n  \n    Home health and personal care aides \n    9,390 \n    $598.25 \n  \n\n\nSources:   CoStar Group, Inc. and Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, May 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nCCPS teachers with a median salary of $54,937 would also be hard pressed to afford the typical rent, especially for units with two or more bedrooms. For an essential part of the workforce there would need to be rental units priced lower at $1,373. Other public sector workers like firefighters, emergency communication officers, and government administrative workers would find it increasingly difficult to find affordable rental housing in the county’s high demand areas.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.8:  Maximum monthly rent for public sector occupations in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Occupation \n    Maximum monthly rent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Planners \n    $1,655.05 \n  \n  \n    Police officers \n    $1,486.75 \n  \n  \n    CCPS teachers \n    $1,373.42 \n  \n  \n    Firefighters \n    $1,335.70 \n  \n  \n    Emergency communications officers \n    $1,104.15 \n  \n  \n    Administrative workers \n    $1,102.88 \n  \n\n\nSources:   CoStar Group, Inc. and Chesterfield County."

As the major north-south interstate corridor along the East Coast, American motorists stopped at the many motels and food stops that sustained a vibrant tourist economy.\nHowever, the creation of Interstate 95 in the late 1950s drew traffic, and with it business, away from the Route 1 corridor. Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, the corridor saw decline and significant changes that presented challenges for revitalization efforts.\nA growing Hispanic population along the corridor has helped reignite commercial activity along the corridor, but housing challenges still exist. Although one of the most affordable areas in Chesterfield County, the corridor has remained generally affordable due to older housing units—many of which are out of style and in need of significant rehabilitation."

These tracts all border Route 1 from Northern Chesterfield to Route 10. This encompasses portions of the Bensley, Bellwood, and northern Chester neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Route 1 study area\n\n\n\nThere are several different housing options along the corridor that serve a diverse population; these includes single-family homes, garden-style apartments, mobile homes, and senior communities. While not included as part of this analysis, it is also important to note that several motels along the corridor are serving as long-term housing options for some Chesterfield residents.\nAccording to tract-level LEHD employment data from the Census Bureau’s OnTheMap application, residents in this area largely work in the retail, health care and social assistance, construction, and accommodation and food services industries. “Administration and support and waste management and remediation services” is a broad category including office administration, security, cleaning, and other routine services for businesses and other organizations.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.1:  Top five most common industries for residents in the study area \n \n  \n    Industry \n    Jobs \n  \n \n\n  \n    Retail trade \n    958 \n  \n  \n    Health care and social assistance \n    919 \n  \n  \n    Construction \n    746 \n  \n  \n    Accommodation and food services \n    710 \n  \n  \n    Administration and support and waste management and remediation services \n    651 \n  \n\n\nSource:   U.S. Census Bureau.

While many workers (42 percent) earn more than $3,333 monthly, or approximately $40,000 annually, the majority earn less.

Like the rest of the county, the pandemic has impacted home prices in one of the county’s most affordable areas. As of 2022, the median sale price was $285,000, a 146 percent increase from 2012 when the median home sale price was $116,000.1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Median single-family home sales price in study area.\n\n\n\n\nSales prices have risen in every part of the study area. The graph below shows median sales price from 2012 through 2022 year-to-date by each of the six Census tracts. The tracts are ordered, roughly, from north to south.\nSome of the highest price growth occurred in Bellwood neighborhood — particularly in tracts 1004.04 and 1004.07. Since 2012, the median sales price in both tracts has risen two-fold; tract 1004.04 rose from $75,000 to $240,000, while tract 1004.07 rose from $87,500 to $256,000. To the south, northern Chester (tract 1004.09) had the highest sales price in both 2012 ($160,170) and 2022 ($300,000). It is the first tract to reach the $300,000 sales price. However, tracts 1004.04 and 1004.07 (which contain much of Bellwood) are on track to also break that ceiling within a year if current market conditions continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: Median single-family home sales price by Census tract.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to afford a home at median price across the study area, a household would need to make $71,952. While this is $17,937 (20 percent) less than the income needed to afford the median sales price for the whole county, this is significantly above what most workers in the study area earn. The table below shows the assumptions made to calculate this figure.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.4:  Calculated income needed to buy median-priced home in the study area. \n \n  \n    Variable \n    Value \n  \n \n\n  \n    Median sales price \n    $285,000 \n  \n  \n    Downpayment \n    5.0% \n  \n  \n    Closing costs \n    1.5% \n  \n  \n    Loan amount \n    $270,750 \n  \n  \n    Interest rate \n    4.72% \n  \n  \n    Monthly utilities \n    $250 \n  \n  \n    Monthly payment \n    $1,678.90 \n  \n  \n    Income needed to buy home \n    $71,952 \n  \n\n\nSources:   CVR MLS and Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey.\n\n\n\n\n\nCensus estimates also show that most renters across the study area live in households that have incomes well below what it would require to buy a home in their neighborhood. Most of the census tracts have median renter incomes between $20,000 and $50,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: Median renter income by tract in the study area.\n\n\n\n\nFor workers who live along the Route 1 corridor, these price increases are continuing to keep homeownership out of reach. Residents largely work in the retail, health care and social assistance, construction, and accommodation and food services industries. Based on the average annual wages in the Richmond region, very few workers in these industries could afford to own a home along the corridor. The few homes that are sold at these prices (below $160,000) are often in disrepair and, if sold, purchased by investors to rehabilitate and sell at a higher price.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.5:  Maximum home sales price for common occupations in the study area. \n \n  \n    Occupation \n    Maximum home sales price \n  \n \n\n  \n    Construction laborers \n    $154,002 \n  \n  \n    Retail salespersons \n    $129,270 \n  \n  \n    Janitors and cleaners \n    $123,211 \n  \n  \n    Home health and personal care aides \n    $107,411 \n  \n  \n    Fast food and counter workers \n    $105,436 \n  \n\n\nSources:   Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey and Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, May 2021."

    "text": "10.5 Renter affordability\nThere are at least 2,805 existing rental units across 25 properties along the Route 1 corridor, with 405 additional units proposed or under construction. This does not include a significant amount of mobile home park units like Shady Hill, which contains at least 110 units alone. Thirty-seven percent of these units are located in a development with some rent restrictions that help ensure affordability.\nSince 2010, rents along the corridor have been on the rise, from a low of $1,108 in 2012 to a decade high of $1,225, when adjusting for inflation. The increasing average rent can be attributed to the entry of several higher-end rentals into the market, like Colony Village.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.6: Median asking rent in the study area.\n\n\n\n\nThe rise in rental demand—and subsequently, prices—along the corridor is putting significant pressure on workers who live in the area. In order to afford the average rent of $1,225 in 2022, a single individual would need to make $49,000 a year, or $25.13 an hour.\nLike the single-family market, the rental market in the study area varies by neighborhood. The map below shows the average asking rent for 17 multifamily properties for which data is available. Rents range from roughly $700 to $1,400. However, the only communities with rents well above $1,000 are the two Colony Village properties just north of Route 288, at the far southern end of the study area.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.7: Asking rent by rental property.\n\n\n\nSome of the most common jobs occupied by corridor residents pay an hourly wage that is nearly half that needed to afford the typical rent. Fast wood workers, home health aides, and childcare workers all have an average hourly wage less than $12.00. In order to afford a rental on a single income, they would need a monthly rent closer to $600—a rent that is becoming harder and harder to find even in older properties like the Bellwood Maisonettes that now list their one bedroom apartments at $1,000 a month.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.6:  Maximum monthly rent for common occupations in the study area \n \n  \n    Occupation \n    Maximum monthly rent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Construction laborers \n    $857.75 \n  \n  \n    Retail salespersons \n    $720.00 \n  \n  \n    Janitors and cleaners \n    $686.25 \n  \n  \n    Home health and personal care aides \n    $598.25 \n  \n  \n    Fast food and counter workers \n    $587.25 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these rent increases, renters along the corridor face increasing challenges. They often need to work additional hours, count on additional income from a partner, roommate, or family member, or compromise quality for affordability.\nThe majority of these properties are considered NOAH given their age, condition, and rent. But few, if any of these properties, have experienced any major renovations in the past decades—meaning that they are at-risk of deteriorating conditions or redevelopment. In either case, this puts residents in a precarious position: continue to live in unhealthy and unsafe conditions or move (voluntarily or involuntarily)."

    "text": "11.1 Rental housing stock\nA growing population, housing affordability challenges, and changing housing preferences have all contributed to the expansion of rental housing throughout Chesterfield County. This strong demand for rental housing on a spectrum—from high-end apartments for working professionals to single room occupancy units.\n\n11.1.1 Total renters\nOver the past decade, the number of renter households in the county has steadily increased. From 2010 to 2019, the number of renters in the county grew from 24,312 to 30,273—a 24 percent increase.\nFrom 2019 to 2020, there was a two percent decline in the renting population. But this decrease of 633 renters may be attributed to the collection challenges of the 2020 Census count and historical undercounting of renters. As rising interest rates and home sales prices persist, the number of renters in the county can be expected to rise as well—further contributing to the need for a diverse mix of rental housing opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Number of renter households in Chesterfield County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2 Rental housing type\nThe rise in renters in Chesterfield County has not led to a commensurate rise in diverse housing options for renters. Over a third (37 percent) of rental housing in the county is made up of single-family detached homes—an estimated 10,984 units. Another third of rental housing is multifamily housing located in buildings with 5 to 19 units. These are typically low-rise and garden style apartments. The remaining third is a mix of smaller multifamily like duplexes, townhomes, and manufactured homes.\nThe distribution of rental housing type has largely remained the same since 2010. The major increases in rental housing have been among single-family detached home rentals (2,502 added since 2010) and multifamily buildings containing 5 to 9 units (1,545 added). Although single-family rentals provide growing families with much needed space, multifamily development can more effectively address rapidly growing demand at scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Rental housing units by structure type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.3 Number of bedrooms\nMost rental housing in the county are two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes. This accounts for nearly half of all rental housing in the county (68 percent).\nThe number of four-bedroom rental homes has been on a steady increase since 2010—from 1,995 to 3,453 in 2020, a 73 percent increase. Although the increasing number of families in search of larger homes has led to a corresponding demand in larger rental homes, the impact can be felt among single adults, especially low-income adults, needing affordable rental opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Rental housing by bedrooms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.4 Rental housing age\nThe majority of existing rental housing in the county was built between 1960 and 1999. This represents a significant portion of rental housing that is at least 20 years of age. Aging rental homes often mean increasing maintenance costs or the need for significant renovations that get passed down to tenants.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Rental housing by year built"

    "section": "11.2 Special types of rental housing",
    "text": "11.2 Special types of rental housing\nTwo significant components of Chesterfield County’s rental housing supply, single-family rentals and manufactured home communities, deserve special attention. This section explores available data and trends for these unique types of housing.\n\n11.2.1 Single-family rentals\nSingle-family home rentals (SFRs) are a growing trend in the rental market as a result of lifestyle changes and affordability challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a dramatic impact on the demand for SFRs, as many individuals and families looked to avoid higher density apartments and have the space to work and learn remotely.1\nSFR in the county have been on the rise—over 28 percent growth in the past decade, according to ACS estimates. This is the most substantial increase among all rental housing types.\nTo obtain a better understanding of the scale and distribution of SFR across the county, parcel records can be used to cross-reference the property’s address with the owner’s address. Generally, these addresses will match for all owner-occupied homes. Those that do not match are most likely not occupied by the owner, which usually implies the house is being leased to other occupants.\nBased on an analysis of these address in the latest parcel records from the county, there are an estimated 13,205 single-family home rentals in the county. These comprise nearly 12 percent of all single-family homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 11.1:  Single-family rentals in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Ownership \n    Number \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Owner-occupied SFH \n    98,364 \n    88.2% \n  \n  \n    Renter-occupied SFH \n    13,205 \n    11.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map below shows the spatial distribution of SFRs across the county. They are found in nearly every community, but are most prevalent in Ettrick neighborhoods surrounding Petersburg and Colonial Heights, between Route 288 and Chippenham Parkway, the Route 1 corridor, and the Hull Street corridor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Single-family rental homes in Chesterfield County\n\n\n\n\nWhen aggregated to the county’s five magisterial districts, single-family rentals are most common in the Bermuda and Dale districts. SFRs comprise more than 13 percent of the total single-family stock in these districts, but this is still not significantly above the county average. The Midlothian district has the lowest share of SFRs at 9 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: Single-family rentals as percent of all single-family homes by magisterial district\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of SFR owners (61 percent) also live in the county, while 29 percent live somewhere else in Virginia. The remaining 10 percent of single-family rental owners live outside of the state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: Location of single-family rental owners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Manufactured homes\nWhile single-family homes saw a major increase in rentals, manufactured homes experienced a significant decrease. From 791 in 2010 to 527 in 2020, the reported number of manufactured homes in the county has been cut down by a third.\nThis estimate from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey severely undercounts manufactured homes located in manufactured home communities (MHCs). Manufactured home communities are a valuable source of affordable housing across Virginia. Chesterfield County is home to a significant amount of MHCs—about 1,500 in total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAdditional details and maps of the county’s manufactured home communities can be found in Chapter 3.\n\n\nHowever, a significant issue faces manufactured home community residents. MHCs often give residents two options, 1) a resident may rent both their home and the lot on which that home is placed, or 2) a resident may own their home and rent the lot on which that home is placed.\nIn both cases, a resident is renting, but residents in the second case are in an especially precarious situation should a MHC owner choose to sell or redevelop their property. MHCs are increasingly at-risk of redevelopment.\nIn 2021, Suburban Village, a MHC along the Midlothian Turnpike, was purchased by a Maryland-based investment firm for $23 million. As the county’s third largest MHC with nearly 220 households, residents and advocates fear for substantial lot rent increases or displacement.\nIn contrast to growing investment firm interest in MHCs, local affordable housing nonprofit, project:HOMES, purchased Bermuda Estates, a 52 unit MHC in 2021. Since the purchase, project:HOMES has made significant improvements to community infrastructure and has been working to replace distressed homes with new high-quality and energy efficient manufactured homes (with support from Virginia Tech’s Virginia Center for Housing Research and Virginia Housing). project:HOMES’s ultimate goal is to empower residents to take ownership of the community."

Nine manufactured home communities are not found in this database; therefore, accurate and recent rent amounts for those properties are not available. Similarly, the single-family rental market is not tracked by CoStar, so these data do not include standalone homes for rent.\n\n11.3.1 Average asking rent\nFrom the early 2000s, rental housing costs had generally been declining in the county. But changing trends in affordability and lifestyle have led to an increasing demand for rentals that has led to a complementary increase in rental housing costs. Since 2012, the average asking rent in the county has been on a steady increase. In Q2 2021, average asking rent in the county reached a two decade high of $1,515, when adjusting for inflation.\nAverage market asking rent per unit is expected to climb in the county—signalling an increasing demand, as well as the construction of higher end rental apartments.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.8: Average asking rent in Chesterfield County. Source: CoStar Group, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.2 Rent by bedrooms\nThe number of bedrooms often impacts rental housing costs—more bedrooms generally equals higher rent. As of 2022 Q3, there is an approximate difference of $420 between the average rent for a 1 bedroom ($1,336) versus a three bedroom apartment ($1,756). Average rent for a 2 bedroom apartment was right in the middle at $1,499.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.9: Average asking rent in Chesterfield County by bedroom."

This pace would not be seen again until 2020.\n\n11.4.1 Multifamily building permits\nMultifamily (five or more units) home starts were not as impacted by the recession. Multifamily building permits saw a substantial increase in 2019 when it reached a two decade high of 1,466.\nDuplexes and smaller multifamily homes like tri-plexes and quads have not seen substantial construction in the county. These types of properties often make up what is called “Missing Middle” housing, a term used to describe smaller multifamily and clustered single-family housing that often offers affordability by design (i.e., smaller homes typically mean lower price).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.10: Annual building permits in Chesterfield County by structure type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4.2 Proposed and in-progress developments\nThere are currently 19 proposed or under construction multifamily developments in the county—an estimated total of 5,039 rental homes2.

From zero completed units in 2018 to a five year high of 1,569 units in 2020, development has been sporadic but is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Most recent developments have consisted of low-rise buildings, offering amenities such as clubhouses, pools, and fitness centers.\nAs of June 2022, there were 33 existing market-rate multifamily developments that were either built in the last five years, under construction, or proposed. An additional development is a mixed-income senior rental housing project by Better Housing Coalition that was completed recently. Development in the past five years has generally been spread across the county, but only one development was completed in the Dale District.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Recent multifamily developments by magisterial district\n\n\n\nThirty-two percent of recent and future development has been or will be constructed in the Midlothian District.

Greenfield development in the western part of the county also contributes to its attractiveness to multifamily and mixed-use developers—providing less risk when compared to redevelopment of brownfield sites.\nThe Midlothian area also offers convenient access to Route 288, where residents can reach major job centers like the County Government Center, or even centers outside the county, like West Creek in Henrico County.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Timeline of recent multifamily units by magisterial district"

    "text": "12.2 Market affordable rental\nMarket affordable rental housing is spread throughout each district of Chesterfield County. However, the majority of market affordable rentals lie along the city-county border. This is a typical trend in most metropolitan areas, wherein early suburban development in the mid- to late 20th century led to small garden apartment development on the outskirts of major cities. But these “inner-ring” suburbs are growing rapidly, especially with more and more diverse populations.1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Map of market affordable units by magisterial district\n\n\n\nThe Bermuda District, which includes the entirety of the Route 1 corridor, contains the largest number of market affordable rental properties, specifically manufactured home communities (8 from the city border down to Route 10). The only other district with manufactured home communities present is the Midlothian District with an estimated 275 homes across two properties—the majority of which are located in Suburban Village.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Total market affordable homes by magisterial district\n\n\n\n\nMarket affordable rentals are largely located in garden style apartments. Garden style apartments are communities made up of small buildings that are at least two stories high, but no higher than four stories. This style of apartment was hugely popular in the 1960s and remained so throughout the 1970s and 1980s.2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: Type of market affordable housing by magisterial district\n\n\n\n\nThe largest of these communities is Crystal Lakes Apartments is located along Chippenham Parkway, with 716 apartment homes. Built in 1967, the property recently underwent renovations in 2020. Subsequently, the property saw a 6 percent increase in average market rent per unit from 2019 to 2020.\nThese older garden style communities may have some amenities like a clubhouse, playgrounds, or fitness centers, but they are often outdated. Twenty-six of the 61 market affordable properties were built in the 1960s and 1970s. Only eight of these properties have reported a renovation; most of these renovations having been completed in the last seven years.\nPreserving market affordable rentals, especially near the city-county border and along transit lines, helps support low- to moderate-income renters. McKinsey & Company, a global management consulting firm, has even focused research on preserving such a valuable asset of local housing stock.3\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.7: Market affordable housing by year built"

    "text": "12.3 Affordable rental\nRental housing supported by federal affordable housing programs is located in each Chesterfield County district. As of early 2022, the Bermuda District contains the most affordable housing units — with roughly 1,622 homes across 14 different buildings.\nThe Dale District compares the second most federally-supported rental housing with 881 homes — nearly half that of the Bermuda District. The location of subsidized housing in these areas is largely related to the provisions of federal programs like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program that favor development in Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs) and Difficult Development Areas (DDAs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Source: National Housing Preservation Database.\n\n\nFigure 12.8: Affordable housing by magisterial district\n\n\nThe bulk of affordable rental housing is supported by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program — 2,312 rental homes. Significant research has been doing on the placement of LIHTC developments and their impact on surrounding communities. A review of these studies found that “property value increased when LIHTC developments are built in low-income areas” and furthermore, decreases in crime are associated with LIHTC development.4 Even the location of LIHTC development in high opportunity areas has proven to have positive impacts.5\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.9: Subsidy type by magisterial district\n\n\n\n\nLIHTC in the County has largely been developed by for profit developers with only one non-profit developer in the county, Better Housing Coalition (BHC). BHC, one of the Richmond region’s largest nonprofit developers of affordable housing, has concentrated much of their work along Route One — where they first developed their first phase of Winchester Green townhomes in 1999.6 Since 1999, Better Housing Coalition has continued to phase development with Market Square and will continue develop on adjacent parcels with Winchester Forest.\nPrograms like LIHTC have a time frame for affordability restrictions. For LIHTC in Virginia, like many other states, there is a 30 year commitment to affordability, but only a 15 year compliance period, wherein property owners can increase rents. By 2040, the majority of existing LIHTC housing (1,984 homes) will be outside the 30 year commitment period. Nonprofit developers will often seek new allocation of tax credits before their commitment period ends, but there is often little incentive for for-profit developers to maintain affordability restrictions past the compliance period.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.10: LIHTC housing at risk of loss of affordability by year\n\n\n\n\nSource: National Housing Preservation Database\nLIHTC developments in the Bermuda and Dale Districts are set to face the end of the affordability commitment period before 2040, but Bermuda District LIHTC properties are largely nonprofit owned and managed — therefore, less likely at risk of loss. But Dale District LIHTC properties could face significant risk of exiting from the affordable housing stock.\n\n12.3.1 Price comparison\nThe following makes comparisons between affordable multifamily and market-rate multifamily rental prices across Chesterfield County. CoStar data is incomplete for some properties, but still provides an accurate and up-to-date average market asking rent per unit by property. The analysis below includes 96 multifamily properties where average asking rent data is available. It excludes manufactured home communities and single-family rentals.\nThe map below shows the location of market rate, affordable (rent restricted or rent subsidized), and market/affordable multifamily developments. The size of the circle represents the average asking market rent per unit for each property. The map shows a large amount of market rate properties located in the northern section of the county, specifically along Midlothian Turnpike and Route 288. Affordable rental properties, including those that are mixed-income, are largely located towards the eastern part of the county along Route 1 and Route 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.11: Map of average rent by property type\n\n\n\n\nMarket rate rents skew towards the $1,500 to $2,000 range, with two properties well-above the $2,000 rent level. These two properties are high-end properties; one being a townhome development and the other a senior independent living with substantial amenities and programming. Affordable rental properties have rents that sit closer to $1,000, which would require at least $40,000 annually to not be cost-burdened. Market/affordable rents are scattered but are typically between $1,000 and $1,500.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.12: Average asking rents by rent type\n\n\n\n\nThe following chart shows the distribution of rental properties by their average rent for each magisterial district. The Bermuda district has the largest share of lower-cost apartments, supplied by both rent-restricted and market rate properties. The Dale district has the next highest number of low-cost apartments of all types. The Midlothian district has the highest average rents, with most properties ranging well above $1,500.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.13: Number of properties by average rent by district"

While recent properties experienced a 1% increase in average rents, existing property average rents increased by 4% — closing the gap to $352. This difference in percent of change over time has continued to Q2 2022.\nFrom Q2 2020 to Q2 2022, average rent for recent properties has changed 3% — from $1,696 to $1,743. Existing property average rent growth was three times (9%) that of recent properties — going from $1,344 to $1,460. From Q2 2017 to Q2 2022, the difference in average rent between recent and existing properties has gone from $410 to $285.\nWhile average rents for recent properties has remained steady, existing property rents have risen dramatically.

    "text": "13.2 Unit mix\n\n13.2.1 Building style\nConsumer preferences can change over time and those preference changes can impact market demand and prices. Multifamily building styles built in the late 20th century were largely in the garden-style apartments. The garden-style emphasizes lower densities and clustered development. Residents typically have ground floor access with no neighbors above.\nExisting rental properties are majority garden-style (85 percent). But the composition of recent multifamily development is much more diverse. Although though garden-style apartments are still being produced, the majority (82 percent) of newer multifamily properties are low- or mid-rise buildings.\nThe shift towards these types of developments provides developers with greater economies of scale. More density makes it more financially possible to finance and develop properties. Without the density that comes through low- and mid-rise buildings, developers have to rely heavily on higher rents or substantial subsidies to make development possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: Share of units by type for existing and recent properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.2 Bedrooms\nExisting rental development mainly consists of two-bedroom rental homes (55 percent) and one-bedrooms (27 percent). More recent developments have shifted towards to one-bedroom rentals (53 percent). The percent of larger rentals - two- and three-bedrooms - being produced has dropped to 36 percent and 9 percent, respectively.\nOne-bedroom rentals meets a growing demand among young professionals and aging seniors in the county, but the lack of larger rental homes leaves growing families out of the multifamily rental market. Single-family homes are increasingly meeting the demand for larger families in need of rentals. Although this often is preferred by families who want greater privacy and more in-home separation, the single-family rental market can impact opportunities for potential homebuyers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: Share of units by bedrooms for existing and recent properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.3 Size\nOn average, the significant number of new one-bedroom apartments are close in size to the county’s existing supply of one-bedroom units—around 750 square feet. New two- and three-bedroom apartments are noticeably larger than older units, however. Recently-built three-bedroom rentals are now approaching 1,500 square feet.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.5: Share of units by size for existing and recent properties"

    "text": "13.4 Location\nNew rental development has occurred all across Chesterfield County in recent years. However, as the map below shows, much of that activity has been concentrated along Route 288 from Midlothian Turnpike south to Hull Street. This development is notable for being located in areas where multifamily housing is not already prevalent.\nOn the other side of the county, there are five new developments along Route 1, plus several more just to the west following Route 10. These recent properties, unlike those along Route 288, do not make up the majority of multifamily housing in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.7: Map of recent and existing multifamily rental properties\n\n\n\n\n13.4.1 Proximity to public transportation\nWithin the county, there are only 20 out of 115 multifamily properties located within a half mile walking distance of a public transit stop. The majority of these properties are existing properties, while only six are recent developments (built in 2017 or later).\nThese transit stops are mainly located at the city-county border along Midlothian Turnpike or along Route One, where the Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC) began local bus service from Falling Creek to John Tyler Community College in March 2020. One recent development (Commonwealth Apartments built in 2022) has taken advantage of an Express Service Park-N-Ride located at Commonwealth Centre Parkway. This transit service provides a direct route from Commonwealth Centre Parkway to Downtown Richmond — whether for work or leisure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overwhelming majority of both recent and existing multifamily properties in the county are located more than a half mile walking distance of a transit stop. On average, the walking distance for all multifamily properties in the county to a transit stop is 3.2 miles — which would take most people nearly an hour to walk. There is little difference between recent and existing properties in terms of distance to transit, but undoubtedly any new multifamily development on the Route 1 corridor will continue to benefit from public transit access.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.8: Percent of units in Chesterfield County near transit by market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.4.2 Proximity to schools\nAcross the entire county, there are 64 schools within the Chesterfield County Public Schools (CCPS) system serving more than 63,000 students. As the county continues to attract more and more families, the desire to be in close proximity to schools at all levels will continue to grow.\nIn the county, there are 39 elementary schools, 12 middle schools, and 11 high schools.\nAll 115 multimfamily properties are within a 30 minute drive to a CCPS school. More specifically, all properties are less than an eight minute drive of a CCPS school. The average drive time for all multifamily properties to a CCPS school is only about 5 minutes, and there is hardly any difference between recent and existing properties in the average drive time — 4.7 and 4.9 minutes, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.9: Driving time to schools in Chesterfield County by market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.4.3 Proximity to grocery stores\nConvenient access to affordable and healthy foods helps support family and individual health. When households have access to food options like fresh fruits and vegetables, they can potentially lower their risk for chronic disease. Close proximity to full service groceries that accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps keep low-income families and individuals out of hunger, but also helps save time and money in commuting.\nWhile many convenience stores accept SNAP, the food options are not always the healthiest. Highly processed foods and other snacks do not provide the nutritional value of many food products found at full service grocery retailers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.10: Mean distance from apartments in Chesterfield County to food stores by market\n\n\n\n\nThe prevalence of convenience stores across the county accounts for their closer proximity to both recent and existing multifamily properties. But the average distance to a full service grocery is over a mile for existing properties and has only increased to just over 1.5 miles for recent multifamily properties.\nThe increasing distance of recent multifamily to full service groceries increases the likelihood of food deserts — low-income, low-access areas. Food access should continue to considered as new multifamily development grows across the county.\n\n\n13.4.4 Proximity to healthcare\nHealthcare access is important to growing communities as households age and new family members are added. Healthy communities are maintained when residents can not only afford healthcare, but also reasonably reach healthcare. General acute care hospitals provide 24-hour patient care and conduct many of the major procedures that help treat chronic illnesses, as well as save people in an emergency situation. Urgent care facilities, on the other hand, provide easy walk-in access for non-emergency healthcare. Often less expensive than a hospital visit, urgent care offers patients help when they are unsure of their illness.\nBeing within a short driving distance to a hospital or urgent care can be lifesaving, but it can also mean more frequent care to support a longer life. In the county, the average drive time to a hospital from a multifamily property is about 12 minutes, while it is 9 minutes to an urgent care.\nMore recent development has been closer to hospitals (10 minutes) than existing development (12 minutes). But recent development has been getting further away from urgent cares (10 minutes) compared to 9 minutes for existing development. This has implications for low- and moderate-income households who can more likely afford urgent care compared to hospital visits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.11: Mean driving time from apartments in Chesterfield County to healthcare facility by market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.4.5 Proximity to job centers\nWith transportation being many households second highest expense after housing, a daily commute to work can quickly eat into a households budget the longer it is. Job centers are located all across the region, but areas with the highest paying jobs are located in Downtown Richmond and business parks like West Creek in Henrico County or Meadowville in Chesterfield County. With many multifamily properties located along major corridors and near the city-county border, proximity to job centers is not a problem for those commuters with personal vehicles. A commute to the city is made easier with the Powhite Parkway and I-95 access. But an assortment of jobs are necessary for a diverse and thriving economy. For any income household shorter commutes help save money, which can be used on housing and life’s other necessities. However, fewer job opportunities for low-income households in close proximity to home mean longer commutes and more money spent on transportation — especially in localities where public transportation isn’t available.\nIn the county, the share of jobs paying more than $39,996 within a 15 minute drive of multifamily properties is near 50 percent for both recent and existing properties — 47 and 49 percent, respectively. Recent multifamily development is increasingly located in areas wherein there are lower paying jobs (below $39,996). This means greater job opportunities for low- and moderate-income households within a short distance. But mixed-use developments, or live-work-play communities, are increasingly desired by diverse households.\nMeeting the needs of houesholds all within a walking distance is a growing trend and is being seen across the region. The Midlothian Special Area Plan helps support development like this which helps households of all kind find employment opportunities with having to depend on a car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.12: Percent of jobs by wage within 15 minute drive by market in Chesterfield County"

    "text": "14.2 Trends\nAll interviewees strongly agreed that the demand for rental housing in the county far exceeds the current supply. One individual stated that the market has “shot straight up”—and that the county will only get more expensive in the near future. Recent interest rate increases may cool the pace of new development, along with pricing out homebuyers with marginal incomes. Together, these symptoms would place additional rental demand on an already limited supply.\nThe growing demand for rental homes can be attributed to many different household types, but respondents noted several important groups. First, families with one or more children, but with incomes too low to purchase a home, are looking for apartments with three or more bedrooms. County schools are often a motivator, as interviewees noted anecdotal increases in households moving from the City of Richmond and the Tri-Cities areas. Due to their higher childcare and other household costs, these families need an affordable rent to balance their budgets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProperty managers of affordable rental communities stated that current waitlists for apartments range from 30 to more than 100 applicants.\n\n\nSecond, there is an acute need for more senior and age-restricted homes, particularly options that are affordable to those on low and/or fixed incomes. These residents have aged out of their previous home due to maintenance or accessibility issues. Finally, among renters who are currently being served by new Class A development, most are one- or two-person households moving into the area to work from home, or are long-term county residents willingly downsizing from a larger home."

    "section": "14.3 Challenges",
    "text": "14.3 Challenges\nInterviewees described a range of obstacles preventing the creation of new rental homes to meet demand. These challenges focus on market conditions, development regulations, and changing attitudes about rental housing.\nFirst, respondents shared that new development has gotten more difficult due to increasing acquisition, material, and labor costs. These trends are currently found in nearly every part of the nation, as well. Among existing properties, Class A, B, and C multifamily assets are all “performing very well,” which demonstrates demand from a wide range of incomes.\nHowever, owners of lower cost, market-affordable rental properties (NOAH) have been less willing to sell their assets, which could lead to revitalization in certain areas, as well as continued preservation of attainable housing options. These long-term, local owners are hesitant to deal with the selling process, and are tax averse with respect to capital gains.\nIn areas where property values may be lower, prevailing market and community conditions can make development unfavorable. The northern Route 1 corridor was noted as an important example: despite its proximity to downtown Richmond and I-95, crime issues were repeatedly noted as a turn-off for developers. Furthermore, several interviewees stated that the low incomes found along that corridor would not support new market-rate development.\nSecond, various development regulations were listed as challenges imposed by the county. These primarily focused on utility connection and permit fees, which participants claimed were high relative to other localities, along with increasing costs associated with road and transportation proffers. Additionally, some developers identified first-floor commercial uses, which are encouraged by the county, as challenging for financing. Standalone multifamily development can be easier to obtain versus mixed-use.\nFinally, nearly all respondents mentioned increasing public and political concern about new rental housing, particularly focused on apartments using public subsidy to serve lower incomes. This is especially a factor along Route 1, which one respondent called a “victim of its own success” following recent successful developments."

    "text": "14.4 Opportunities\nIn spite of the listed challenges, interviewees noted that there were several opportunities to support rental housing development in the county, and specifically along the Route 1 and Eastern Hull St corridors.\nLIHTC developers benefit greatly in the competitive scoring process when proposed developments are located in officially designated “revitalization areas.” This has helped support LIHTC development along the Route 1 corridor by Better Housing Coalition, but continuing this designation practice could help support LIHTC development in other parts of the county, where affordable rental housing is needed just as much. Tax abatements, even small amounts, like the recent Route 1 corridor tax abatement policy, also help in the LIHTC scoring process—increasing the likelihood of tax credit awards.\nContinued expansion of public transportation along major corridors in the county would also help support affordable rental housing development. Being within 1/2 mile distance of public transportation is another scoring criteria for many publicly-financed housing developments.\nInterviewees also saw specific opportunities for each corridor. Many saw greater opportunities for rental housing development along the Hull Street corridor due it having less of a “stigma” and better socioeconomic conditions to support mixed-use and mixed-income developments. One interviewee felt that Hull Street will continue to see more development activity and interest, growing organically like the western Midlothian Turnpike.\nRespondents did refer to opportunities along the Route 1 corridor, especially for the revitalization or reuse of vacant and underutilized commercial spaces near the Chester area. But interviewees felt that the county would need to provide meaningful incentives to attract market-rate development to the northern section of Route 1."

However, the completion of Interstate 95 in the late 1950s drew traffic and business away from the highway. Since then, areas up and down the entirety of U.S. Route 1 have experienced decline and significant change that present challenges to revitalization.\nAs a home to residents and businesses, the Route 1 corridor in Chesterfield County is well-positioned to be one of the county’s most vibrant suburban communities to existing and future generations. In close proximity to the City of Richmond and with convenient access to Interstate 95, the corridor is centrally located in the Richmond metro area and could play a pivotal role in the growth and development of the entire region.\nCurrent conditions on the northern section of Route 1 prevent significant reinvestment, but recent efforts by the County improve those conditions and incentivize new and much needed development. The 2018 Northern Jefferson Davis Special Area Plan and the 2019 Northern Jefferson Davis Real Estate Market Study provide Chesterfield County with initial tools to revitalize Route 1. Momentum has continued with the Route 1 Residential Overlay District, the Northern Jefferson Davis Incentive Program, and Greater Richmond Transit Company’s Pilot Bus Service.\nMuch of the new rental housing development has occurred at the southern end of the study area — pulled towards the intersection of W. Hundred Road (State Route 10) and Route 1, where there is a dense concentration of retail shopping options.\nThis study focuses its research on the six census tracts that straddle the Route 1 corridor from the Richmond-Chesterfield County border to the north and State Route 10 to the south. This encompasses portions of the Bensley, Bellwood, and northern Chester neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Route 1 corridor study area"

    "section": "15.2 Rental housing supply",
    "text": "15.2 Rental housing supply\nThe following describes the existing rental housing supply along the Route 1 corridor.\n\n15.2.1 Number of rental homes\nThe number of rental homes along the Route 1 corridor has increased by 26 percent between 2010 and 2020—a total of 708 renter households. Much of this rental housing growth occurred in the latter half of the decade, from 2014 and onward.\nFrom 2010 to 2012, rental housing was in decline—most likely a reflection of the latter year’s impacts from the Great Recession. During this timeframe, the construction industry struggled to keep pace with the growing demand for new rental housing.\nFrom 2019 to 2020, there was a higher estimated percent change (13 percent) in renter homes than in previous years. Although this could be a significant impact of the COVID-19’s impact on the rental housing market, margins of error for the data in 2020 are also higher than previous years; therefore, these changes should be interpreted with caution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.2: Renter households in Route 1 corridor\n\n\n\n\nBased on 2010 and 2020 estimates, the increase in rental housing has largely occurred at the northern end of the Route 1 corridor in the Bensley area. All areas saw some increase in renter housing except for Census Tract 1004.04, which covers the eastern side of Route 1 from Falling Creek down to Bellwood Road. This census tract experienced a decrease of 180 renter households.\nWhile unable to determine the causes or from where these renter households came from, this area of Route 1 contains several manufactured home communities and naturally-occurring affordable housing — all of which place households at greater risk of displacement.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.3: Change in renter households by tract from 2010 to 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.2 Multifamily properties\nOf the estimated 3,376 occupied rental homes from the U.S. Census Bureau, CoStar captures at most 2,417 of them that are located across 20 multifamily properties. These multifamily properties contain at least 12 rental homes and the majority of these properties (70 percent) are garden-style apartments. The majority (70 percent) of existing properties were built before 1976, and of these fourteen properties, only two have a recorded renovation — Collindale Apartments (renovated in 1990) and Falling Creek (renovated in 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.4: Total number of multifamily units by property status\n\n\n\n\nThe city-county border was located much further north before the annexation of Northern Chesterfield by the City of Richmond in 1970. In spite of this change, these older rental properties represent the extent to which rental housing development in the mid-20th century stretched into the county.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.5: Map of multifamily properties along Route 1 Corridor\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.3 Manufactured home communities\nManufactured housing grew out of the “travel trailer” popularity of the mid-20th century. These trailers evolved into the manufactured housing when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development developed standardized building codes and the the Federal Housing Administration began offering mortgage insurance on both homes and lots.\nCommunities of manufactured homes grew out of the decline of “travel trailer” camp grounds and the increase in manufactured housing production. With the need for land to place manufactured homes, there were few options aside from existing land where similar types of housing were already permitted, or where a household could afford a plot of land themselves. Land owners also saw a value in developing manufactured home communities for those who wanted the experience of a single-family detached home, but could not afford to purchase.\nBut the stigma of manufactured housing has plagued both residents and developers for decades. There have been no new manufactured home communities in Virginia in that same amount of time. Nonetheless, manufactured home communities have carved out a particular niche along the housing spectrum, offering an affordable albeit often precarious housing opportunity.\nManufactured home communities offer rental housing opportunities across the county by one of two ways:\n\nA household owns their manufactured home and rents the land in which their home is placed (i.e. paying lot rent); or\nA household rents the manufactured home that is owned by the community owner (i.e. paying rent where lot rent is included).\n\nAccurate data on manufactured home communities is difficult to come by. Community owners may allow for the additional of homes on a continuous basis without approval, or some homes may be left abandoned after a tenant has vacated. Anecdotally, some owners have even subdivided a single home into four units to be rented. This makes it difficult to have an accurate count of households.\nThe northern Route 1 corridor has a substantial number of manufactured home communities — specifically 10 out of the county’s known 17 manufactured home communities are located in the area. This accounts for at least 514 individual manufactured homes, or 31 percent of all homes located in a manufactured home community. This includes the sixth largest manufactured home park in the county, Shady Hill, which was recently purchased in July 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.6: Map of manufactured home communities along Route 1\n\n\n\nNotable among these communities is Bermuda Estates, which was purchased by affordable housing nonprofit, project:HOMES, in September 2020. Only one of two nonprofit owned and managed manufactured home communities in the Commonwealth, Bermuda Estates has seen significant infrastructure improvements and the replacement of homes with new energy efficient manufactured home models by project:HOMES.\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.1:  Manufactured home communities along northern Route 1 corridor \n \n  \n    Name \n    Estimated homes \n  \n \n\n  \n    Holiday Mobile Home Park \n    140 \n  \n  \n    Shady Hill Mobile Home Park \n    110 \n  \n  \n    Conner Homes \n    54 \n  \n  \n    Bermuda Estates \n    54 \n  \n  \n    Bellwood Mobile Home Park \n    41 \n  \n  \n    Falling Creek Mobile Home Park \n    35 \n  \n  \n    Parkway Trailer Court \n    28 \n  \n  \n    Ponderosa Mobile Home Park \n    27 \n  \n  \n    Bellwood Rd LLC Trailer Park \n    13 \n  \n  \n    Unnamed \n    12 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.4 Single-family rentals\nAs mentioned previously in Chapter 11, the growth of the single-family home rental (SFR) market is impacting all parts of the county. And the Route 1 corridor is no exception.\nAlong the northern Route 1 corridor, there is an estimated 1,008 single-family home rentals — about 20 percent of all single-family homes the area.1 The highest concentration of SFR is within Census Tract 1003 (Bensley), where 28 percent of all single-family homes are believed to be renter occupied.\nSFR is a growing demand among renters as homeownership continues to be out of reach for many, but it also serves a growing demand among households looking for greater space and privacy not offered in apartments. As seen in Chapter 13, nearly 54 percent of recent multifamily housing is two-bedrooms or less, leaving many larger households competing for less supply. SFR is filling the gap where multifamily developers are often falling short due to increasing construction costs and public opposition.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.7: Percent of single-family homes that are renter-occupied by tract and neigborhood\n\n\n\n\nThe majority (68 percent) of owners of SFR along the corridor live somewhere else in the county, while 25 percent live outside of the county but somewhere else in Virginia. Fewer than 7 percent of SFR owners live outside of Virginia — the largest share of which has an owner in Florida.\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.2:  Owner location for single-family rentals along Route 1 corridor \n \n  \n    Ownership \n    Number \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Owner in Chesterfield \n    690 \n    68% \n  \n  \n    Owner in Virginia \n    256 \n    25% \n  \n  \n    Owner out of state \n    62 \n    6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.5 Rental prices\nMedian rents in the northern Route 1 corridor have fluctuated in the last decade. But increases in the typical rent have most significantly occurred in the southern part of Bellwood (Census Tract 1004.07) where Colony Village was developed. In this part of the corridor, median rent has increased by 24 percent from 2010 to 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.8: Median inflation-adjusted rent by tract: 2010 to 2020\n\n\n\n\nThere are clear differences in median rents between the northern and southern sections of the Route 1 corridor. Northern Chester and southern Bellwood had median rents above $1,300 in 2020 — $1,314 and $1,367, respectively. Median rents in the northern part of the corridor ranged from $780 to $1,059 – hundreds of dollars less in all cases than the southern part of the corridor.\nMuch of this difference in rental markets is no doubt a result of newer developments like Colony Village and The Jane at Moore’s Lake. There have been few new multifamily developments in the northern section aside from Better Housing Coalition developments.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.9: Median inflation-adjusted rent by neighborhood: 2010 to 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.5.1 Multifamily rents\nCoStar’s analytics allows for a broad snapshot of average rent data along Route 1 on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Average rent per apartment was on a steady decline from 2002 until the rental market began to recover in 2013. It was not until Q3 2014 that average rent began to experience consistent increases quarter over quarter from $1,109 to $1,214 in the most recent 2022 quarter.\nFrom 2017 to early 2020, the typical average rent increase was about $3 but between Q1 2020 and Q2 2020 the average rent jumped $15 from $1,195 to $1,210. It was during this timeframe that the pandemic began to impact housing markets, leading to significantly low rental vacancy rates as the eviction moratorium was put in place and increasing demand for housing away from the denser urban environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.10: CoStar average asking rent for Route 1 corridor\n\n\n\n\nAverage rent disaggregated by number of bedrooms shows fairly steady increases for all bedroom types, especially one- and two-bedroom apartments. Studios and three-bedroom apartments in the area have seen decreasing rents in recent years. In fact, average rent for three bedroom apartments are now $56 cheaper ($1,431) than they were at the start of 2012 ($1,487).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.11: CoStar average asking rent for Route 1 corridor by bedroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.5.2 Single-family rents\nSingle-family rentals are not often listed via sources that provide consistent or reliable data. Facebook groups and other social networks often play a major role in advertising SFR, but the Central Virginia Regional Multiple Listing Service (CVR MLS) does pick up some of this market. Within the last year, there were 44 single-family homes rented through the MLS.\nThe average listed rent for one of these SFR was $1,336 — nearly $100 less the average rent for a three-bedroom apartment. Single-family detached homes fetch higher rental prices versus condominiums or duplexes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.12: Listed MLS rents in Route 1 corridor\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of SFR listed through MLS are three-bedroom homes (54 percent), while 18 percent are four-bedrooms or more — an option that apartments do not often offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.13: Percent of MLS-listed SFR by bedrooms in Route 1 corridor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.6 Conditions\nAging rental properties require substantial capital in order to maintain properties. Even properties built in the 1980s are approaching half a century in age. Along the Route 1 corridor, there are 1,812 rental homes that were built before 1980. The largest share of these homes are located in the Bensley area (Census Tracts 1003 and 1004.04).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.14: Percent of rental units built before 1980 by tract\n\n\n\n\nOf the 23 CoStar-listed multifamily properties, 14 (61 percent) were constructed before 1980. There was no major multifamily development activity again until 2000 when Better Housing Coalition constructed Winchester Green Apartments’ first phase. There has been little new multifamily development along the corridor during the last two decades — activity has largely been spearheaded by Better Housing Coalition and Emerson Companies. With few newer developments, there are fewer options for those who are looking to rent along the corridor — either having to choose a pre-1980s apartment, which are often in need of renovation, or among new luxury apartments that are often outside the budgets of existing renters along the corridor.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.15: Multifamily units in Route 1 corridor by year built\n\n\n\n\nCoStar’s building rating system also provides a snapshot of condition of multifamily properties. Eighty-three percent of multifamily properties along the corridor are three-star or less — meaning that in terms of quality and amenities that these buildings are relatively average or simply functional. In comparison, four-star properties are “are constructed with higher end finishes and specifications, providing desirable amenities to residents and designed/built to competitive and contemporary standards,” while five-star properties are “the luxury end of multi-family buildings defined by finishes, amenities, the overall interior/exterior design and the highest level of specifications for its style…”\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.16: Percent of rental units in Route 1 corridor by CoStar star rating\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the Manufactured Home Community Coalition of Virginia conducted an assessment of manufactured home communities in Central Virginia. Their assessment included all but three of the communities identified in this study.\nBased on an analysis of community socio-economic conditions, spatial patterns, and design characteristics, MHCCV created a typology that helps understand community conditions and potential areas for concern. To supplement their typology, communities not identified previously were assigned a typology.2\nOf the ten communities located along the corridor, six are either obsolete or under pressure. Obsolete communities were found to have “severe, long-standing deficiencies in infrastructure, housing condition, private property, tenure, amenities, and management. Under pressure communities often house low-income families with children and are located in areas close to daily needs. They have poor conditions and are at the most risk for redevelopment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.17: Percent of MH units in Route 1 corridor by park typology"

    "text": "15.3 Single-family rental versus purchase\nFor renter households along the corridor, the ability to purchase a home may be out of reach for many. But SFRs are filling a gap for households looking for the opportunity to live in a single-family detached home — providing more space and privacy for growing families. At the same time, SFRs are typically the entry-level homes that many first-time homebuyers would be able to afford.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last year, the median home sales price for a home along the corridor was $274,470, which would require a monthly mortgage payment of $1,614.98. This is nearly $300 more than the price of a SFR in the area — $1,336.87 a month.\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.3:  Calculated income needed to buy median-priced home in the study area \n \n  \n    Variable \n    Value \n  \n \n\n  \n    Median sales price \n    $285,000 \n  \n  \n    Downpayment \n    5.0% \n  \n  \n    Closing costs \n    1.5% \n  \n  \n    Loan amount \n    $270,750 \n  \n  \n    Interest rate \n    4.72% \n  \n  \n    Monthly utilities \n    $250 \n  \n  \n    Monthly payment \n    $1,678.90 \n  \n  \n    Income needed to buy home \n    $71,952 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to afford the median home sales price, a household would need to make $69,213 annually, while an SFR would require $53,475 — almost $16,000 less.\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.4:  Calculated income needed to rent single-family home in the Route 1 corridor \n \n  \n    Variable \n    Value \n  \n \n\n  \n    Average rent for single-family home \n    $1,336.87 \n  \n  \n    Income needed \n    $53,474.80 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the most recent ACS estimates for renter household incomes, the typical renter in most Census tracts would not be able to either rent a SFR nor purchase the typical home in the area. Renters in southern Bellwood and northern Chester are more likely to afford a SFR, but with their incomes they are still nearly $30,000 short of being able to purchase a home priced at $274,470.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.18: Renter income and income needed to purchase or rent single-family home in Route 1 corridor\n\n\n\n\nWith homeownership being out of reach for many in the area, the next best option is often renting a single-family home. Low supply of homes for sale is often being exacerbated by owners or investors converting potential starter home opportunities into rental properties. Although this is meeting a demand in the rental market, the opportunity to reach the first rung of the homeownership ladder is so often pushed further away when the cost to rent a home is only a few hundred dollars away from being able to afford a monthly mortgage."

    "text": "15.4 Proximity to amenities\nBeing close to amenities like grocery stores and employment can make a difference in housing affordability for many families on a tight budget. Less time spent traveling often means less money spent on personal vehicle maintenance and gas. It also means more time to spend with family members and more savings that can be spent on housing costs.\n\n15.4.1 Public transportation\nPublic transportation is not prevalent throughout Chesterfield County. But in March 2020, the Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC) partnered with Chesterfield County and the Department of Rail and Public Transportation (DRPT) to pilot local bus service from Falling Creek to John Tyler Community College. Along the Route 1 corridor, there are 24 stops — 12 along each north and south side.\nLocal bus service provides those without personal vehicles greater access to employment opportunities and the ability to reach community amenities such as grocery stores. Of the 23 properties along the corridor, 19 are within a half mile walking distance of a bus stop.\nIn fact, the average distance of properties along this section of the corridor to a bus stop is 0.42 miles. This allows for nearly 2,000 renter households with less than a half mile access to bus service to the City of Richmond, John Tyler Community College, or retail at the intersection of Route 1 and Route 10.\nHowever, this access is slightly more difficult for renters living in apartment communities with affordable rents. One-in-four of all rent-restricted apartments are beyond 1/2 mile walking distance to a transit stop, compared to just 13 percent of all market-rate apartments in the corridor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.19: Percent of units in Route 1 corridor near transit by rent type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4.2 Schools\nWithin the footprint of the Route 1 corridor study area, there are four Chesterfield County Public Schools (CCPS). These include: - Bensley Elementary School - Bellwood Elementary School - C.E. Curtis Elementary School - Thomas Dale High School\nStudies have found that longer commute times have negative impacts on students, including less time spent on activities that promote greater health outcomes.3 Researchers generally define “long” school commutes as those greater than 30 minutes one-way.\nMultifamily properties along the corridor are all within a 30 minute drive of at least one Chesterfield County Public School. In fact, all multifamily properties are fewer than eight minutes away from a school. The average time to at least one CCPS school is slightly more than five minutes.\nStill, the affordable communities are further away on average compared to market-rate properties. All but one rent-restricted community has a drive time of more than six minutes. This may detrimentally affect students who walk to school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.20: Driving time to schools in Route 1 corridor by rent type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4.3 Grocery stores\nClose proximity to a full service grocery store provides families with a greater ability to purchase fresh meat and produce on a regular basis. When access is limited, many families have depend on more convenient options like corner stores and gas stations, where foods are often cheaper but lower quality. This impacts individual health and leads to greater prevalence of preventable diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.\nProperties along the corridor are much more likely to be located within close proximity to a convenience store than a full-service grocery. Of all 23 properties, only one is located within a half mile distance of grocery store — the Food Lion located at the Chippenham Parkway interchange.\nThe average distance between an apartment and a full-service grocery is 1.39 miles, while the average distance to a convenience store or small market is 0.40 miles. For those without a personal vehicle, the choice in traveling to get food is often an easy one to make when convenience stores like Dollar General are much more accessible.\nOn average, both affordable and market-rate apartments are a little less than half a mile from a convenience store. However, residents in market-rate properties are more likely to be significantly closer (1.2 miles away) to a SNAP retailer, such as a major grocery store, versus those in rent-restricted properties (1.8 miles).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.21: Mean distance from apartments in Route 1 corridor to food stores by type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4.4 Healthcare\nHealthcare access is an important factor in improving not only individual health, but community health. Acute care general hospitals are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and provide patients with wellness services as well as emergency medical episodes that require intensive care. Urgent care facilities provide walk-in clinic services for minor illnesses and injuries outside a hospital setting. Access to both of these levels of care provide communities with a spectrum of care.\nAlong the corridor, the closest acute care hospital is Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Hospital, while the Concentra Urgent Care located in the Bellwood area is the closest urgent care facility. The average drive-time for a resident in a multifamily property along the corridor to an acute care hospital is 13.5 minutes, while their average drive-time to an urgent care is 7.5 minutes.\nNationally, the average travel time for residents in a suburban setting to a hospital is 12 minutes, slightly below that of the multifamily residents along the corridor.4\nThere are no significant differences in the average driving time to both hospitals and urgent care facilities between affordable and market-rate properties in the corridor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.22: Mean driving time from apartments in Route 1 corridor to healthcare facility by type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4.5 Job centers\nLiving close to well-paying jobs can increase economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income households. When those opportunities are a further distance from where someone lives, that can often mean more money spent on commuting and less money for essentials like healthcare and housing.\nMultifamily properties regardless of type or location along the corridor are generally well-located in relation to jobs. However, the northern section of the corridor sees greater proximity to more jobs — largely because of the City of Richmond.\nFurthermore, properties closer to the city-county border are also in closer proximity to jobs paying greater than $3,333 a month, or $39,996 annually. This is the highest wage category available in the data. On average, 54 percent of the jobs located within a 15 minute drive of properties pay more than $3,333 per month. Workers in both market-rate and rent-restricted apartments have nearly the same access to jobs of different wages.\nFewer high-paying job opportunities exist towards the southern end of the corridor, despite higher end developments like The Jane and Colony Village. This most likely means that many residents are commuting longer distances away from the corridor for work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.23: Percent of jobs by wage within 15 minute drive by rent type in the Route 1 corridor"

    "text": "15.5 Public and private investments\nChesterfield County has largely focused revitalization efforts on the northern section on the Route 1 corridor. The Northern Jefferson Davis Special Area Plan was adopted in 2018 and reflects the County’s ongoing commitment to improve quality of life for residents of the corridor. Recent public projects include:\n\nBensley Park field renovations and paving.\nShared-Use Path planned for Route 1 from Marina Drive to Elliham Avenue.\nFalling Creek Ironworks Park improvements in planning.\n\nAdditionally, the Board of Supervisors approved the Route 1 Residential Overlay ordinance in 2019, which allows for high density multifamily development by-right in C3 and C5 zoned parcels with some restrictions. This ordinance also reduced parking requirements for apartments located within a quarter-mile of bus stops and encourages less auto-centric development, which has historically stifled revitalization of the corridor.\nThe Board of Supervisors also extended the Route 1 tax abatement policy. The policy provides the developer of a qualifying project with a grant equal to 80 percent of their increasing real estate taxes for the first seven years after completion of the project. Over the final three years, the grant reduces to 60, 40, and 20 percent, respectively. Better Housing Coalition’s Winchester Forest development, which will result in 160 rental homes by early 2024, is the first development to utilize this incentive.\nWith these incentives, as well as the Route 1 GRTC pilot, the County has continued to invest in the corridor to spur much-needed development. With dwindling supply of market affordable housing and at-risk manufactured home communities, many low- and moderate-income families will have few to no options for safe and stable housing.\nPrivate development interest is also coming to the corridor with Thalhimer Realty Partners proposing a mixed-use project at the Bellwood Flea Market site at the southeast corner Route 1 and Willis Road. This redevelopment project would see 690 new residential units and commercial space across 40 acres — bringing additional homeownership and rental opportunities to the corridor. Projects like this help bring new economic activity to the corridor and additional rooftops to justify additional commercial development along the corridor.\nNonprofit development interest has continued from Better Housing Coalition further down the corridor at the historic Colbrook Motel site south of Route 10. At this site, they plan to develop 156 rental homes in an apartment and townhome setting. Meanwhile, Maggie Walker Community Land Trust is in the early planning stages for an agricultural neighborhood development off of Swineford Road. MWCLT will offer homeownership opportunities under their community land trust model — often serving first-time home buyers of color.\n\n15.5.1 Case study\nThe Jane at Moore’s Lake\n Photo: Apartment Finder.\nThe Jane at Moore’s Lake is an upscale apartment complex located off Route 1 in northern Chester. The property developed by Emerson Companies was once an interstate vacation retreat during the early to mid-20th century. Brick cottages surrounded a recreational lake that was incredibly popular and brought thousands to during the warm summer travel months.\nBut the development I-95 brought interstate travel away from Route 1 and also business. Later the site was converted to a mobile home park during the latter half of the 20th century and investments in improvements and maintenance began to wane. Cue developers George Emerson and Phil Roper who began the redevelopment process in the mid-2010s after the success of their Colony Village complex just up the road.\nThe Jane at Moore’s Lake is only a small part of a phased development envisioned by Emerson and Roper. This first phase brings $60 million in investment to the corridor and with it, 385 new apartments — ranging from one- to three-bedrooms and rents from $1,200 to near $2,000. The first building was completed in 2019, while the third and final building was completed recently. Amenities include a clubhouse, pool, fitness centers, and Wi-Fi, as well as rentable garage space. Apartments at The Jane largely serve young professionals working in the county, as well as the region.\nA one-bedroom, one-bath apartment at 636 square feet now rents for as low as $1,512 a month.5 According to CoStar data, The Jane has a vacancy rate of 3.9 percent, which is below the overall market vacancy of 5.2 percent.\nThe second phase of Moore’s Lake is coming and has the potential to create an additional 1,200 new housing opportunities — including 500 apartments, 238 condos, 62 single-family homes, and 30 townhomes.\n Photo: Richmond BizSense.\nDevelopment in this section of the corridor has benefited from the close location of the 288 and I-95 interchanges, as well as dense commercial development at the crossroads of Route 10 and Route 1. In addition, developers have noted that negative associations with Route 1 have largely prevented market rate development north of Willis Road."

    "text": "16.1 The Hull Street Corridor\nFor the purposes of this analysis, this corridor is defined as the Census tracts 1002.05, 1002.06, 1002.08, 1002.09, 1002.10, and 1002.11. These tracts include many of the neighborhoods directly adjacent to Hull Street Road from Chippenham Parkway to Courthouse Road.\nIt should be noted that portions of Census tracts 1002.09 and 1002.10 span from Hull Street to Midlothian Turnpike. This results in the inclusion of rental properties that are not technically tied to the Hull Street corridor. Census tract analysis allows for consistency between the analyses conducted here and the previously in Chapter 15 with the Route 1 corridor.\nUnlike Route 1, Hull Street (Route 360) does not have the storied interstate tourist history that has since evaporated with the development of the interstate highway system. Along Hull Street towards the City of Richmond, there was significant commercial development that fronted Hull Street, most of which has experienced decline and disinvestment.\nBut much of the development along Hull Street in Chesterfield County today is much less dense. The corridor in the county remains car-centric with no multifamily properties fronting the corridor and no manufactured home communities. Most development along the corridor is concentrated towards the eastern end at the city-county border, while development fronting the corridor becomes more rare west of Pocoshock Creek and the new Manchester Middle School.\nOpportunities exist for multifamily development along the Hull Street corridor, but there has been none in recent years and there are none planned for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.1: Eastern Hull Street Road corridor"

    "text": "16.2 Rental housing supply\n\n16.2.1 Number of rental homes\nDespite the low number of multifamily properties in the Hull Street corridor, the number of renters — like all areas of the county — has experienced significant increases. From 1,054 renter households in 2010 to 2,388 in 2020, renter households have more than doubled in a decade (a 126 percent increase). Much of this growth occurred between 2018 and 2020, when renter households increased 78 percent from 1,337.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.2: Renter households in Eastern Hull Street study area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.2 Multifamily properties\nBased on a survey of CoStar listed multifamily properties in the Hull Street corridor study area, there are only 1,198 apartments — accounting for only half of renter households (53 percent) in the area. The low number of apartments along the corridor begs the question as to where many renter households find housing when there are so few options in a typical apartment setting. A large share of these apartments are oriented towards the Midlothian Turnpike corridor at the recently developed Element at Stonebridge apartments — 400 mid-rise apartments built in 2016.\n\n\n\n\nTable 16.1:  Total number of multifamily units by property status \n \n  \n    Name \n    Corridor \n    Estimated apartment homes \n  \n \n\n  \n    Element at Stonebridge \n    Midlothian \n    400 \n  \n  \n    Rollingwood Apartments \n    Hull Street \n    278 \n  \n  \n    Cross Creek Apartments \n    Hull Street \n    225 \n  \n  \n    Cloverleaf Lake Townhouse Apartments \n    Midlothian \n    210 \n  \n  \n    Wayside Townhouse Apartments \n    Hull Street \n    81 \n  \n  \n    Amber Leaves Apartments \n    Hull Street \n    67 \n  \n  \n    Danzler Place Townhomes \n    Hull Street \n    18 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo multifamily properties actually front the Eastern Hull Street corridor. The four multifamily properties in closest proximity to the corridor are more closely associated with the Walmsley Boulevard (State Route 647) corridor.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.3: Map of multifamily properties in Eastern Hull Street study area\n\n\n\nWith no manufactured home communities in the area, single-family home rentals (SFRs) are the option left for many Hull Street corridor residents. An estimated 900 SFRs are located throughout the study area - 14 percent of all single-family detached homes.\nHigher concentrations of SFR are located in Census tracts 1002.10 and 1002.11; tracts that adjacent to the Chippenham Parkway and along the city-county border. These tracts have an estimated 21 percent and 20 percent of single-family detached homes being utilized as SFR, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.4: Percent of single-family homes that are renter-occupied by tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.3 Rental prices\nRent prices, as estimated by the American Community Survey (ACS), show very little change in rental prices along the Hull Street corridor, except in Census tract 1002.08. This Census tract encompasses a large portion of the Rockwood neighborhood, which has no recorded multifamily properties. Nonetheless, the estimated median gross rent in this area has increased by 64 percent from 2010 to 2020 — from $1,231 to $2,021. Margins of error for this tract remain high in 2019 and 2020 - roughly +/- $1,000 in both years — likely due to small sample sizes.\nOther Census tracts in the area have more consistent rent increases - particularly Census tracts 1002.06, 1002.09, and 1002.10. Census tract 1002.11 does not account for a median gross rent until 2020 ($980), which is strange given that CoStar recognizes three multifamily properties in this Census tract, all of which were built pre-1980.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.5: Median inflation-adjusted rent by tract: 2010 to 2020\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on the areas adjacent to the Hull Street corridor, CoStar’s data show an average rent across the four existing properties. Changes in average rent have been slight over the past decade, but have been on a steady climb — reaching a decade max at the start of 2022 with an average rent of $1,140.\nOver the course of the pandemic, rents in the area have seen upticks much like other parts of the county, including the Route 1 corridor. From Q1 2020 to Q3 2022, average rent saw a 2 percent increase from $1,088 to $1,110. But in 2022 so far, average rent has been in decline from its decade max — potentially signaling some cooling of the hot pandemic housing market.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.6: CoStar average asking rent for Eastern Hull Street corridor\n\n\n\n\nBreaking out average rent by bedrooms shows a similar pattern among all bedroom sizes, except for studio apartments, in which there are none listed in the study area. Three-bedroom apartments did see a substantial increase in the latter half of 2021 — a $61 increase (5 percent increase) from $1,240 to $1,301, but, like all other apartment types, have seen declines in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.7: CoStar average asking rent for Eastern Hull Street corridor by bedroom\n\n\n\n\nVery little rental price data exists for SFRs in the study area. Across the past four years, there have only been 25 listed SFRs. Thirteen of these 25 SFRs are single-family detached homes, while the remaining are largely condominums or townhomes (11).\nList prices have ranged from $900 for a duplex in 2019 to $1,809 for a single-family detached home in 2022. Generally, single-family detached homes have commanded rents above $1,400 and often offer three-bedrooms and two baths. These rents are on par with recent two-bedroom apartments rents in the area — often making a decision between an apartment or single-family detached home on the rental market easy for a family of three or more.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.8: Listed MLS rents in Eastern Hull Street Road corridor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.4 Conditions\nMuch of the rental housing stock (62 percent) in the Eastern Hull Street corridor was built after 1980 — 1,472 rental homes. The largest share of occupied rental housing was built in the latter half of the 20th century (1960 to 1999). These buildings are anywhere from 20 to 50 years old and are most likely in need of modest to major upgrades.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.9: Eastern Hull Street rental housing by year built and census tract\n\n\n\n\nMultifamily property construction has been rare in the corridor for much of the last half century. Only one development was completed in the 2000s — Element at Stonebridge. This development was the result of the Cloverleaf Mall redevelopment and is oriented towards Midlothian Turnpike, rather than the Eastern Hull Street corridor.\nMore relevant to the corridor is Cross Creek Apartments, the most recent development in close proximity to the Eastern Hull Street. This 225 unit garden style apartment property was completed in 1991 — 31 years ago — and was the first multifamily development along the Eastern Hull Street corridor since 1978.\nThe only multifamily property located directly off of the Eastern Hull Street corridor is the Wayside Townhouse Apartmentsm which were built in 1967 — the earliest multifamily development in the area. Only one property (Element at Stonebridge) is rated at four stars, while all other properties are three stars or less. Although largely functional, these lower-tiered properties can expect to need renovations in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\nTable 16.2:  Eastern Hull Street corridor (and nearby Midlothian corridor) multifamily properties \n \n  \n    Name \n    Corridor \n    Year Built \n    CoStar Rating \n  \n \n\n  \n    Element at Stonebridge \n    Midlothian \n    2016 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    Cross Creek Apartments \n    Hull Street \n    1991 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    Rollingwood Apartments \n    Hull Street \n    1978 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Amber Leaves Apartments \n    Hull Street \n    1973 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Cloverleaf Lake Townhouse Apartments \n    Midlothian \n    1972 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Danzler Place Townhomes \n    Hull Street \n    1969 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Wayside Townhouse Apartments \n    Hull Street \n    1967 \n    NA"

    "text": "16.3 Single-family rental versus purchase\nThe typical renter in the study area requires an income of $74,441 to afford the median home sales price of $299,000 — the median home sales price for homes sold in the last year. But median renter household incomes in the area top out at $64,952, which are just over $9,000 less than what is needed to purchase a home. With homeownership out of reach for many renter households in the area, SFRs are often the next best option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 16.3:  Income needed to afford median priced home in Eastern Hull Street area \n \n  \n    Variable \n    Value \n  \n \n\n  \n    Median sales price \n    $316,750 \n  \n  \n    Downpayment \n    5.0% \n  \n  \n    Closing costs \n    1.5% \n  \n  \n    Loan amount \n    $300,912 \n  \n  \n    Interest rate \n    4.72% \n  \n  \n    Monthly utilities \n    $250 \n  \n  \n    Monthly payment \n    $1,838.09 \n  \n  \n    Income needed to buy home \n    $78,775 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe typical listed rent for a SFR is $1,479 — a few hundred dollars less than the monthly mortgage payment for the average-priced home ($1,838). The income needed to afford a SFR at this price without being cost-burdened is $59,160, which is still well-above what renter households in the study area can afford. In some cases, that gap in income to afford rent is over $25,000.\n\n\n\n\nTable 16.4:  Calculated income needed to rent single-family home in the Eastern Hull Street corridor \n \n  \n    Variable \n    Value \n  \n \n\n  \n    Average rent for single-family home \n    $1,479.00 \n  \n  \n    Income needed \n    $59,160.00 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith convenient access to higher paying jobs, this section of the corridor could support additional high-end multifamily development. But for lower income renter households, who already have few options along the corridor, increased development could have negative impacts if affordable multifamily homes are not included, as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.10: Renter income and income needed to purchase or rent single-family home in Eastern Hull Street corridor"

    "text": "16.4 Proximity to amenities\nBeing close to amenities like grocery stores and employment can make a difference in housing affordability for many families on a tight budget. Less time spent traveling often means less money spent on personal vehicle maintenance and gas. It also means more time to spend with family members and more savings that can be spent on housing costs.\n\n16.4.1 Public transportation\nAlong the Eastern Hull Street corridor there is no public transportation within the county. The nearest stop is just across the city-county border at the Chippenham Mall Shopping Center and is part of Route 1C of the Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC). This route takes riders into Downtown Richmond and as far as Northside neighborhood within the city.\nTo date, extension of GRTC down Hull Street through the county has only been explored in concept. A proposed concept for GRTC expansion could potentially extend service to commercial retail at Commonwealth Center in Midlothian.\nFor the five multifamily properties located closest to the Hull Street corridor, no properties are within a half mile walking distance to public transit. For individuals without a car, accessing public transit means walking an average of two miles to the Chippenham Mall stop of Route 1C. It also means walking down a portion of Hull Street that is a six-lane highway interchange that has no sidewalks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.11: Eastern Hull Street multifamily by distance to transit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.2 Schools\nAlong the Eastern Hull Street Corridor, there are two Chesterfield County Public Schools:\n\nManchester Middle School; and\nJ.A. Chalkley Elementary School\n\nNearby, but more oriented towards the Midlothian Turnpike are:\n\nA.M. Davis Elementary School; and\nProvidence Middle School\n\nAll five properties closest to the Eastern Hull Street corridor are within an ideal distance to a Chesterfield County Public School — less than a five minute drive. This provides many families with a convenient drive to take their children to school. The average drive-time distance to a public school for these properties is 3.6 minutes. Properties north of Hull Street would be zoned for either Davis Elementary or Providence Middle School — but no multifamily properties exist on the northside of Hull Street.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.12: Eastern Hull Street multifamily by drive time to schools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.3 Grocery stores\nSeveral ethnic food stores exist at the 360 West Shopping Center at the northwest corner of Turner Road and Hull Street. But full service grocery stores like Food Lion and Kroger are located further west, outside of the study area. Although only a short drive down the road, multifamily properties in the study area are much closer to a convenience store or small market, rather than a full service grocery store.\nThe average distance to a convenience or small market is about half a mile (0.46 miles), while the average distance to a full service grocery store is 1.51 miles. This distance is negligible for those with a personal vehicle, but for those without a car or unable to drive due to an impairment (e.g. physical or mental disability), traveling to the nearest Food Lion or Kroger can be quite difficult. Those having to walk face a near mile and a half walk along a highway with no sidewalks and vehicles going over 55 mph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.13: Eastern Hull Street multifamily by distance to food access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.4 Healthcare\nComparatively, multifamily properties along the Eastern Hull Street corridor are closer to acute general hospitals (an average of 8.6 minutes driving distance away) than properties along the Route 1 corridor (13.5 minutes). Two acute general care hospitals are within close proximity to multifamily properties. This includes Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Hospital down Hull Street towards the city, as well as Chippenham Hospital, which is easily accessed by the Chippenham Parkway interchange at the city-county border. Urgent care access is similar to hospital access — as the average drive-time distance is only 8 minutes.\nTwo Patient First urgent cares are located within close proximity to Eastern Hull Street corridor properties. One is located further west down Hull Street at the Genito Crossing Shopping Center, while the other is located on Midlothian Turnpike. The close proximity of these healthcare resources to existing, as well as potential, multifamily properties along the Eastern Hull Street corridor provides a significant benefit to households experiencing a health crisis or who are in need of on-going care. Both travel times are significantly below the national travel time to a hospital in a suburban setting (12 minutes).1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.14: Mean driving time from apartments in Eastern Hull Street corridor to healthcare facility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.5 Job centers\nThere are very few commercial retail centers located along the Eastern Hull Street corridor. Furthermore, multifamily properties — located off of Walmsley Boulevard, a secondary road — are not adjacent to any major commercial uses. This means that many residents must walk quite a distance or more likely drive to work. There is little nuance in regards to property location to jobs as all properties are located within a mile of each other.\nOf the jobs within a 15 minute drive of properties in the area, nearly half (49 percent) of those jobs pay more than $3,333. The large share of jobs paying such high wages can be attributed to the proximity of the Chippenham Parkway interchange, which allows commuters to take Chippenham to the Powhite Parkway and into Downtown Richmond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.15: Eastern Hull Street multifamily by number of jobs within a 15 minute drive"

    "text": "16.5 Public and private investments\nThe development patterns of the Eastern Hull Street corridor have largely been similar to that of the Route 1 corridor — car-centric suburban development. However, the county portion of the Hull Street corridor does not have the storied interstate travel history of the Route 1 corridor. As such revitalization along the Eastern Hull Street corridor has not been a major priority.\nNonetheless, the county has continued to invest in this part of the county as its population has grown. In the summer of 2020, the County completed construction on a brand new middle school facility — Manchester Middle School. This replacement of the former 1964 building for $41 million now serves up to 1,100 students.\nFurther down the corridor and outside the study area, the County is also encouraging the redevelopment of older retail shopping centers and strip malls like Rockwood Square Shopping Center. The County recently approved plans to develop Rockwood Square into 332 condominiums and townhomes.2\n\n16.5.1 Case study\nRockwood Square Shopping Center\n Photo: Areaprops.com\nAlthough outside of the Eastern Hull Street corridor study area, the Rockwood Square Shopping Center redevelopment offers an example of the possibilities for aging shopping centers within the study area. This strategy of redeveloping older strip malls and commercial shopping centers is a vision among Chesterfield County planners to transform struggling commercial retail hubs into more vibrant mixed-use developments.\nStanley Martin Homes is proposing the development of the Rockwood Square Shopping Center — in line with the County’s overall goals for the Rockwood area. Their proposal, which was approved by the County Board of Supervisors in June 2022, will see the development of 322 condominiums and townhomes across 25-acres, which includes the Rockwood Golf Park. Although no homes will be for rent and no sales prices have been determined, this project represents the potential for increased residential development along other portions of the Hull Street corridor."
