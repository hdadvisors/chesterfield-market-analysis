    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis report is currently in development. It was last updated on 2022-09-14.\n\n\nChesterfield County community revitalization staff seek additional information about current rental market dynamics, particularly along the county’s major commercial corridors. This report compiles and analyzes data on subsidized, market-affordable, and newly-built rental units to help strategically guide the county’s future community development investments using CDBG and other grant funds.\n\n\nThis report is divided into four parts:\nPART 1-A: LITERATURE REVIEW\nThis part summarizes recent and current public planning documents that guide Chesterfield’s housing strategies, provides distinctions between the different methods for measuring housing affordability, explores the definition of “naturally-occurring affordable housing” (NOAH), and assesses current research regarding the concentration of low-cost housing and differences in length-of-stay between homeowners and renters.\nPART 1-B: DEMOGRAPHIC AND AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS\nThis part provides insight into household incomes, housing cost burden, and housing affordability across Chesterfield County. Where possible, data is disaggregated by tenure, household type, age, and race/ethnicity. Data sources are identified and explained in the first chapter of this part, with special attention paid to reliability for datasets based on survey samples. The final chapter of this part is an affordability analysis for the Route 1 corridor within the county.\nPART 2-A: COUNTYWIDE MARKET ANALYSIS\nThis section summarizes the existing stock of rental units within the county and provides an analysis of recent price and production trends in the rental market. The second chapter conducts a spatial analysis of recent multifamily, market affordable, and affordable rental housing in the county. The third chapter is a market comparison between recent multifamily (built in the last five years or slated for future construction) development and existing rental supply in the county. The final chapter summarizes in-depth interviews with nonprofit and for-profit multifamily developers in the county.\nPART 2-B: CORRIDOR CASE STUDIES\nThis section provides a market and spatial analysis of multifamily developments along two major corridors in the county: the Route One Corridor from the city-county line to Route 10 and the Eastern Hull Street Corridor from the city-county border to Genito Road."

    "section": "3.2 30 percent standard",
    "text": "3.2 30 percent standard\nA household spending more than 30 percent of their gross income on housing costs is often referred to as cost-burdened. This standard (and the term “cost burden”) is the most commonly used benchmark for housing affordability. It is simple to understand, and simple to calculate, because only two data points are needed: gross household income and total housing costs.\nThe 30 percent threshold is used because any income used for housing beyond that share cannot be used for transportation, healthcare, childcare, groceries, and other necessary household expenses. Generally speaking, a cost-burdened household will more commonly have trouble balancing their monthly budget, and will also face significant challenges when attempting to save or invest their income.\nThis income-to-cost ratio was originally set at 25 percent when the federal government began designing housing assistance programs in the 1960s and 1970s. The threshold was increased to 30 percent in the 1980s. Today, the 30 percent cap is used to set household rent levels for public housing, Housing Choice Vouchers, and many other housing assistance initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlthough it has been the go-to measure in housing affordability, the 30 percent standard has several criticisms. Chief among these critiques is that living expenses vary from household to household.2 A family of four will likely face much higher and additional costs for things like childcare, food, and transportation, when compared to a single adult with the same income.\nSecondly, different income groups don’t spend the same way.3 Higher income households can have much more flexibility to spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs when compared to a low income household. Using the 30 percent standard in this case can sometimes overestimate the share of higher income households experiencing cost burden.\nOther critics also reference the fact that the 30 percent standard does not account for things like location and housing quality. A household living in a very walkable community will spend very differently from a household that has to invest a lot of money in transportation (i.e., gas and car maintenance).\n\n\nCost burden data is available from the U.S. Census Bureau in the American Community Survey. Tables B25091 and B25070 break down the share of gross household income dedicated to housing costs for homeowners and renters, respectively.\nTable B25091 defines “selected monthly owner costs” for homeowners as:\n\nMonthly mortgage payments,\nReal estate taxes,\nHomeowners and/or mortgage insurance, and\nNecessary utilities.\n\nTable B25070 defines “gross rent” for renters as:\n\nMonthly contract rent payments, and\nNecessary utilities paid directly by tenants.\n\nIn Chesterfield County:\nThe table below combines those datasets to show the number of cost burdened households by tenure in Chesterfield County.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1:  Cost burden by tenure in Chesterfield County \n \n  \n    Cost burden \n    Homeowners \n    Renters \n    Total \n    Percent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Not cost burdened \n    78,661 \n    15,005 \n    93,666 \n    73.6% \n  \n  \n    Cost burdened \n    18,502 \n    13,266 \n    31,768 \n    25.0% \n  \n  \n    Not computed \n    427 \n    1,369 \n    1,796 \n    1.4% \n  \n  \n    Total \n    97,590 \n    29,640 \n    127,230 \n    100.0% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2016-2020 5-year estimates.

This reflects the median family income being about 1.5 times greater than the minimum income required to purchase the median priced home, using the current 30-year fixed mortgage rate published by the Federal Housing Finance Board. A higher HAI value reflects higher affordability in the for-sale market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe full Housing Affordability Index methodology is available on the NAR website.\n\n\nThe HAI has steadily decreased as housing prices continue to rise across the nation. As of June 2022, the preliminary HAI for all 50 states was 98.5. This assumed a median single-family home price of $423,300, a mortgage rate of 5.60%, and a median family income of $91,952.\nIn Chesterfield County:\nThe table below shows the inputs and calculated HAI for Chesterfield County as of August 2022. The median sales price is collected from all 2022 year-to-date single-family home sales accessed from the Central Virginia Regional Multiple Listing Service (CVR MLS).4 The 30-year fixed mortgage is sourced from the national weekly average published by the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey for the week ending September 1, 2022. The median family income is the latest value published by the U.S. Census Bureau.5\nThe current HAI for Chesterfield County is 118.8.

    "text": "3.4 NLIHC’s Housing Wage\nThe National Low Income Housing Coalition has published its Out of Reach report every year since 1989 to bring attention to the widening gap between actual wages and the cost of rental housing in the United States. Within this report, NLIHC calculates its Housing Wage, an affordability measure that estimates the wage a full-time worker must earn to afford rental housing based on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) fair market rent (FMR) without spending more than 30 percent of their income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe latest 2022 Out of Reach report and data is available on the NLIHC website.\n\n\nNLIHC utilizes multiple data sources, such as the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and average wages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to create an affordability measure that focuses on the economic gap between household incomes and the price of rental housing.\nFair market rent is another a key statistic that helps NLIHC determine the Housing Wage. FMR is calculated by HUD every fiscal year and is a reflection of the median rent in a given area. FMR is largely used to set rental assistance limits under the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program (Section 8).\nThere have been few, if any, specific critiques of the Housing Wage statistic. But issue can be taken with the fact that FMR is set at the metropolitan level. Therefore, the FMR in Chesterfield County, regardless of location, is the same as the FMR in the City of Richmond and other localities in the Richmond, Virginia Metropolitan Statistican Area (MSA). This means that the Housing Wage does not fully account for the nuances that exist across the regional rental market.\nWhile the Housing Wage is helpful in determining the relationship between jobs and housing prices, it does not help to measure the gap in affordable housing, or rather how many households are facing affordability challenges.\nIn Chesterfield County:\nNLIHC released their latest Out of Reach report in July 2022. According to NLIHC, the annual wage required to afford a two-bedroom rental unit in Chesterfield County was $47,560, or an hourly wage of $22.87. NLIHC estimates that the typical renter wage in Chesterfield County is $17.15—nearly $6 short of the wage needed to afford a typical two-bedroom rental in the region."

    "text": "3.5 CNT’s H+T Affordability Index\nThe Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT) developed the Housing + Transportation (H+T) Affordability Index in 2006 as a result of a Minneapolis-St. Paul report conducted for the Brookings Institution’s Urban Markets Initiative. This affordability measure is a robust indicator of the role that geographic location has on the two major costs faced by American households: housing and transportation.\nCNT expands on the 30 percent standard with the inclusion of transportation costs in an affordability standard. Based on extensive research CNT found that 15 percent was a reasonable standard at which to set affordable transportation costs; it follows that a household should pay no more than 45 percent of their household income on housing and transportation costs combined.\nCNT’s transportation cost model takes into account several factors that influence how much a typical household pays for transportation, including commuting data, public transportation access, housing density, and consumer behavior.\nWith the H+T Affordability Index, CNT offers detailed data down to the Census Block Group-level (i.e. a neighborhood-level). The index is provided in terms of a regional typical household based on a median income, the average number of commuters per household, and the average household size. This allows the index to consistently measure the impact of neighborhood factors on a typical household’s housing and transportation costs.\nThe index is expressed as a set percentage of income—in other words, what the typical regional household spends on housing and transportation based on their home’s location.\nIn spite of the H+T’s comprehensiveness, it has its pitfalls. The nature of the model requires the use of a standard household which only sets a baseline from which to compare other households to. This can make it difficult to make conclusions about households with incomes lower or higher than that baseline. To help with this, CNT offers the index based on a regional moderate income household—80 percent of the regional median household income, while maintaining the typical regional household size and commuters.\nThe index also suffers from outdated data sources. The most recent update of the model took place in 2017 and utilized data that predated this year to calculate the index. Therefore, the index does not capture recent trends in housing and transportation costs that tend to exacerbate cost burden.\nIn Chesterfield County:\nThe most recent H+T Affordability Index for Chesterfield County stated that the typical regional household, with an income of $59,919, 1.19 commuters per household, and a household size of 2.58 people, spent 53 percent of their income on housing and transportation combined.\nCNT disaggregated housing and transportation to account for 30 percent and 23 percent, respectively.\nThese costs increase for the regional moderate income household with an income of $47,935—increasing to 63 percent, or 38 percent on housing and 25 percent on transportation."

    "text": "3.6 Residual income approach\nThe residual income approach is a relatively new and uncommon method for measuring housing affordability. Rather than begin with housing costs compared to income, this more holistic metric sums up all other necessary household costs and determines what is left over (“residual”) and available for housing. That residual amount can then be compared to local housing prices to assess affordability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe most comprehensive assessment of the residual income approach compared to other housing affordability measures is Measuring Housing Affordability: Assessing the 30 Percent of Income Standard, a research paper published by The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies in 2018.\n\n\nBenefits of the residual income approach include the ability to:\n\nFactor in real-life household cost estimates for transportation, healthcare, and other necessary expenses,\nAccount for a range of household types and compositions, particularly those with children, and\nMore accurately reflect the affordability distinctions between low and high income households.\n\nHowever, drawbacks of this metric include:\n\nGreater data and methodological requirements, making it less accessible to calculate,\nDifficulty in providing a simple explanation of the methods to laypersons, and\nThe potential to inflate affordability challenges in high-cost areas.\n\nIn Chesterfield County:\nA full calculation of housing affordability in Chesterfield County using the residual income method is beyond the scope of this report. However, we may use a sample from the Self-Sufficiency Standard (SSS) dataset published by the Center for Women’s Welfare at the University of Washington. According to the Center, this Standard:\n\n…defines the income working families need to meet a minimum yet adequate level, taking into account family composition, ages of children, and geographic differences in costs. The Standard is an affordability and living wage economic security measure that provides an alternative to the official poverty measure.\n\nAs an example, we will estimate residual income for a household with the following characteristics:\n\nTwo full-time working adults (married) and two elementary school-age children,\nA total household income equal to 80 percent of the Richmond, Virginia Area Median Income (AMI), and\nFull-time residency in Chesterfield County.\n\nFirst, we calculate the gross and take-home household incomes. According to HUD’s FY 2021 Income Limits, the income for a four-person family at 80 percent AMI is $72,000. Based on current federal and state effective tax rates, the estimated total household income after taxes for this family would be $58,111. This amounts to a monthly take-home wage of $4,843.\nNext, we determine the 2021 SSS monthly cost estimates for a four-person household with two working adults and two elementary school-age children in Chesterfield County. These total costs (housing excluded) are $4,480.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.3:  Self-Sufficiency Standard monthly costs \n \n  \n    Expense \n    Amount \n  \n \n\n  \n    Child Care \n    $1,086 \n  \n  \n    Food \n    $922 \n  \n  \n    Transportation \n    $576 \n  \n  \n    Health Care \n    $775 \n  \n  \n    Miscellaneous \n    $462 \n  \n  \n    Taxes \n    $1,092 \n  \n  \n    Child Care Tax Credit (-) \n    ($100) \n  \n  \n    Child Tax Credit (-) \n    ($333) \n  \n  \n    Total \n    $4,480 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then subtract these costs from the total take home pay of each household to determine what is left to be spent on housing costs.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.4:  Residual income available for housing for family of four at 80 percent AMI \n \n  \n    Pay, expenses, and residual income \n    Amount \n  \n \n\n  \n    Monthly take-home pay \n    $4,843 \n  \n  \n    Monthly expenses (-) \n    ($4,480) \n  \n  \n    Residual income \n    $363 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis $363 available for housing is far below than the required monthly payment to afford the median-priced single-family home ($1,717, from HAI section above) and the market rent for apartments with three or more bedrooms ($1,759, via CoStar6) in Chesterfield County.\nFor additional examples, we can estimate residual income for some of the county’s most common household types and incomes7:\nHomeowners\n\nMarried registered nurse and Chesterfield County police officer, with two school-age kids, and a household income of $136,410\nMarried couple, aged 65 and over, with no kids, and a monthly Social Security benefit of $2,739.10 (average amount for retired worker and aged spouse)\n\nRenters\n\nSingle Chesterfield County Public Schools teacher, with no kids, and a household income of $54,937\nSingle female home health aide, with an infant and preschooler, and a household income of $23,930\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the monthly take home pay for each of these households, along with their calculated residual incomes based on SSS cost estimates.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.5:  Monthly take home pay and residual income for selected households \n \n  \n    Household \n    Take home pay \n    Residual income \n  \n \n\n  \n    Registered nurse, police officer, 2 kids \n    $8,594.58 \n    $5,206.02 \n  \n  \n    CCPS teacher \n    $3,589.33 \n    $2,618.01 \n  \n  \n    Retired senior and spouse \n    $2,328.24 \n    $250.94 \n  \n  \n    Home health aide, 2 kids \n    $1,685.92 \n    -$2,000.74 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese cases show a wide range of housing affordability depended on income and assumed households expenses. For two-earner families with above-average salaries, finding a home to buy in the county is likely not a major challenge. For single workers with strong wages, finding an affordable apartment in Chesterfield may not be difficult. However, student loans, car payments, and other possible debt—not included in this analysis—would change this outcome.\nOn the other hand, lower income families—especially those with greater expenses associated with young children—must make hard choices to balance their budget. These concessions may include forgoing healthier (and more expensive) food options, putting off necessary healthcare treatments, and finding cheaper housing that is further away from their jobs. Other forms of public assistance, such as EBT, would also help."

But the choice of one over the other is dependent on its ultimate use.\nFor this report, and for most other housing needs assessments, the standard 30 percent (cost burden) methodology is preferred for its ubiquity.\nIf you want to better understand how location impacts costs, the CNT H+T may be the most useful. If you want to focus on the unique challenges that individual households face, the residual income approach may be worth the additional analysis required."

Widely referred to as naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH), or market-affordable housing, these properties are a growing concern for communities facing housing affordability challenges.\nThe preservation of NOAH properties has been a growing strategy to support affordable housing in communities as the ability to quickly develop new units has been stifled by labor shortages, rising land prices, and supply chain issues. NOAH is at great risk of being lost because it often requires greater investment to maintain and more likely to be redeveloped—in turn contributing to a loss of affordable housing units."

    "text": "4.2 Defining NOAH\nWhile research around NOAH has been growing over the past several years, an universally-accepted definition still does not exist. But general agreement among advocates and practitioners is that NOAH units are older, outmoded, and in less desirable locations.\nWhen these characteristics are placed into the context of a community’s rental market, rents are generally lower than the typical rental unit because NOAH units are of comparably lower quality than newer units on the market.\nCoStar, a commercial real estate and analytics provider with its global research operations based in Richmond, Virginia, conducted an analysis of NOAH properties in Fall 2016 at the request of Urban Land Institute’s Terwilliger Center for Housing.\nThis analysis concluded that 76 percent of the 335,978 multifamily properties in their database were NOAH properties. CoStar came to this conclusion based on their proprietary rating system, which gives each property a star rating from one to five stars, wherein one- and two-star properties are the equivalent of Class B and C properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhat are Class B and C properties?\nThe commercial real estate industry utilizes a property classification system to help investors, lenders, and brokers quickly understand and communicate the quality of a property. The system classifies real estate properties as A, B, C, or D.\nNOAH properties generally fall into either Class B or C.\nClass B\nThese properties are generally in good condition for being built within the last 20 years, but the exteriors and interiors are generally considered outdated. Amenities are much less than those found in a high end apartment. Renovations may have occurred recently and there is little deferred maintenance.\nClass C\nThese properties were built within the last 30 years or are a much older property that has had recent renovations. Exteriors and interiors are outdated, and amenities are very limited. Improvements to the property show some age and there may be some deferred maintenance."

However, the CoStar database does not fully capture all of these communities.\nIn 2016, the Manufactured Home Community Coalition of Virginia (MHCCV) conducted a study of mobile home parks in Central Virginia and found that Chesterfield County was home to roughly 1,500 units within parks—the highest of any Central Virginia locality, with the second highest locality being Prince George at 831.\nThe analysis below includes all manufactured home communities in Chesterfield County identified in the MHCCV report. They are appended to the CoStar records to create a fuller NOAH dataset. However, the only known variables are property location and number of units within each park. Accurate rent levels for most of these communities are not known at this time.\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Amount\nChesterfield County is home to 5,155 market-affordable rental units as of August 2022. These apartments are predominately in garden-style buildings with 200 to 250 units per property. A smaller share of these NOAH units are found in manufactured home communities and low-rise multifamily buildings.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1:  NOAH properties and units by style \n \n  \n    Style \n    Properties \n    Units \n  \n \n\n  \n    Garden \n    19 \n    3,548 \n  \n  \n    Manufactured Home Community \n    13 \n    1,491 \n  \n  \n    Low-Rise \n    4 \n    116 \n  \n  \n    Total \n    36 \n    5,155 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: CoStar Group, Inc.\nThis NOAH inventory is approximately 16 percent of the county’s total number of rental units according to the latest Census Bureau estimates.2 However, that estimate includes the approximately 10,000 single-family homes leased out in Chesterfield.\n\n\n4.3.2 Location\nNOAH properties are spread throughout all parts of Chesterfield County, but like most NOAH properties nationwide, they are largely located in the inner suburbs—areas that saw early development towards the middle of the 19th century. These includes garden style apartments like Falling Creek Apartments along Route One or manufactured home communities like Suburban Village off of Midlothian Turnpike.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Location and type of NOAH\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Rent levels\nAs of early 2022, average rents in Chesterfield’s NOAH units range from $744 to $1,491 depending on the number of bedrooms. The minimum gross annual income to afford the average 2-bedroom market-affordable apartment is $47,560.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2:  Current rent by bedroom in NOAH properties \n \n  \n    Bedrooms \n    Rent \n  \n \n\n  \n    Studio \n    $744 \n  \n  \n    1 Bed \n    $1,023 \n  \n  \n    2 Beds \n    $1,189 \n  \n  \n    3 Beds \n    $1,491 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: CoStar Group, Inc.\nMarket rents in Chesterfield’s NOAH units have increased significantly as demand for lower-cost apartments continues to exceed the supply. Much of this price growth has occurred since 2015. Prior to that year, the average 3-bedroom NOAH unit could be rented for less than $1,200 per month.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Average asking rent by bedroom for NOAH properties\n\n\n\n\nSource: CoStar Group, Inc.\n\n\n4.3.4 Age\nThe majority of Chesterfield’s NOAH properties are older than 40 years.
