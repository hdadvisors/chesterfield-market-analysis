# About {-}

::: {.rmdcaution}
This report is currently in development. It was last updated on **2022-04-20**.
:::

Chesterfield County community revitalization staff seek additional information about current rental market dynamics, particularly along the county’s major commercial corridors. This report compiles and analyzes data on subsidized, market-affordable, and newly-built rental units to help strategically guide the county’s future community development investments using CDBG and other grant funds. 

## Report outline {-}

This report is divided into four parts:

**PART 1-A: LITERATURE REVIEW**

This part summarizes recent and current public planning documents that guide Chesterfield's housing strategies, provides distinctions between the different methods for measuring housing affordability, explores the definition of "naturally-occurring affordable housing" (NOAH), and assesses current research regarding the concentration of low-cost housing and differences in length-of-stay between homeowners and renters.  

**PART 1-B: DEMOGRAPHIC AND AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS**

This part provides insight into household incomes, housing cost burden, and housing affordability across Chesterfield County. Where possible, data is disaggregated by tenure, household type, age, and race/ethnicity. Data sources are identified and explained in the first chapter of this part, with special attention paid to reliability for datasets based on survey samples. The final chapter of this part is an affordability analysis for the Route 1 corridor within the county.

**PART 2-A: COUNTYWIDE MARKET ANALYSIS**

**PART 2-B: CORRIDOR CASE STUDIES**
